							",4 month work term,"Clearbanc co-founders Michele Romanow and Andrew D'Souza knew there had to be a better way to fund your business than staking your house or sacrificing ownership of your company. 

Michele and Andrew deeply understand the pains of building a business; Michele bootstrapped five companies, one which was acquired by Groupon, and sits on the other side of the table as a judge on ""Dragon's Den,"" Canada's equivalent of ""Shark Tank."" Andrew, meanwhile, has raised hundreds of millions of dollars for multiple startups and is an investor and advisor to many others. 

They've seen the broken funding process from all sides, and the idea for Clearbanc was inspired by their own experiences and struggles building companies and working with other entrepreneurs. 

Clearbanc has invested in thousands of companies using data science to identify high-growth funding opportunities. This data-driven approach takes the bias out of decision making. Clearbanc has funded 8x more female founders than traditional VCs, and has invested in 43 states in the US in 2019.

The tech community is very active in the area with regular (usually monthly) meetups for multiple different groups giving you an opportunity to connect with others and usually enjoy some free food if you get there early. Speaking of food, there are dozens of truly excellent restaurants  within walking distance - you will miss this when you go back to school. On top of all that, there is also the fact that Toronto is the home to sports team in most/all major leagues, has great museums and cultural attractions, attracts the best shows in music and theatre, and is one of the best cities in the world.

Plus, when you graduate and are looking for a place where you can make a difference by changing the way the world learns, think about D2L and the step ahead of the rest you would be by networking within D2L on your work term.","What you will get out of working for D2L Labs?

As a Developer with D2L Labs you will get to explore tough problems and help figure out they might be solved.

You will get the chance to experience all aspects of software development - from ideation, to design and development, deploying to production, and iterating on user feedback.  You will apply your technical expertise to solve the problem at hand and will pick up new languages and technologies as needed. The technology stack is not fixed - the goal is to get the answers we need quickly and iteratively, and so we use the technologies that are best suited to do that for a given problem.

You will have the opportunity to look for those moonshots that need to be taken, and help figure out how to make them real.","What you'll bring to D2L Labs:

Technical experience and problem solving skills: You will apply your solid grasp of the fundamentals which you have leveraged in a combination of your school and side projects.
Entrepreneurial spirit and enthusiasm: You will help the team define the problems to tackle and the approaches to take.
A thirst to tackle challenges: You know that changing the way the world learns is not an easy task but you will not let that stop you from trying.
Keen interest in exploring your own ideas: You like to work on projects/hackathons to grow your skills and see your ideas come to life.
Experience with one or more of these technologies would be a bonus:
Modern web frameworks (e.g. AngularJS, React.js, Backbone.js, etc.)
Server side technologies (Node.js, PHP, .NET, Java, etc.)
Mobile apps (iOS, Android, Mobile-hybrid, etc.)
