										Summer 2021 Compliance & AML Program
									



",TD Bank Group,TD Securities,1,Open for Applications,Toronto,Intermediate,4,"
								Jan 19, 2021
								
							",4 month work term,"TD Description 
All companies are not the same. What makes TD special as a business is also, what makes us special as an employer. Why TD?

TD's Colleague Promise: A better you. A better us.
A more confident you means a stronger us. We empower you to grow your skills, gain new perspectives, and create impact at work and in your community. That's our unique and inclusive culture.

TD Compliance & AML Overview: 

Anti-Money Laundering
Criminal activities, such as drug trafficking, human trafficking, corruption, and other offenses, can generate large amounts of profits. Embezzlement, insider trading, bribery, and fraud schemes can also produce large profits and create the incentive to legitimize the ill-gotten gains through money laundering.  Money laundering occurs when criminals engage in financial transactions with the purpose of disguising the illicit origin of their funds.
Financial institutions arealso susceptible to terrorist financing which raises funds for terrorist activities from legitimate sources, as well as criminal activity. Under the laws and regulations of Canada and the other jurisdictions in which it operates, TD must establish both an Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorist Financing (AML/ATF) and Sanctions compliance programs.
 
Global Anti-Money Laundering (GAML) is responsible for AML/ATF and Sanctions regulatory compliance and prudential risk management across TD's global footprint. GAML acts as proactive and trusted advisors to TD Business Lines, while supporting a consistent, adaptable and effective culture across the organization, ensuring money laundering and terrorist financing risks are appropriately identified and mitigated.  We direct the design, content and enterprise-wide implementation of TD's AML Program, which also includes ensuring that everyone both understands and complies with economic sanctions and anti-bribery/anti-corruption regulations.
 
Compliance
The TD Bank Group operates businesses that are subject to oversight by banking, securities, and insurance regulators. These regulators include the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI - the federal banking and insurance regulator), provincial securities regulators such as the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) and the Financial Services Commission of Ontario (FSCO - the provincial regulator for insurance sales, mortgage brokering, loan & trust companies, and credit unions). TD is also accountable to self-regulatory organizations like the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) for the conduct of its registered employees. The purpose of these regulations is to protect consumers of financial products and to ensure fair and transparent markets.
 
The TD Bank Group takes its regulatory commitments seriously and has a large Compliance Department of over 400 staff dedicated to regulatory issues. The role of the TD Compliance Department is to assist the various TD lines of business in understanding the regulations applicable to them, and ensuring that they are effectively managing compliance risk through the implementation of appropriate policies and procedures. In addition to providing advisory support to the businesses, the Compliance Department also conducts ongoing monitoring and testing to assess the level of compliance with regulatory requirements. These advisory and oversight functions allow the Chief Compliance Officer to provide an opinion to the Board of Directors as to the overall state of compliance within the firm.

Department Overview 
Co-op and Internship opportunities allow you to gain valuable work experience across a number of the businesses at TD.  You will work with experienced colleagues, receive world class training, and be part of a community of students across TD, where you will have an impact, grow as individual and experience our culture of care.

The candidate will work on the development and validation of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method for visualizing utero-placental vasculature and quantifying placental blood flow. Many major pregnancy complications, which contribute significantly to fetal morbidity/mortality and lifelong challenges are linked to placental blood flow abnormalities. The proposed technique for non-invasive blood flow evaluation (without the use of potentially harmful contrast agents) may therefore lead to refinements in the treatment and management of affected pregnancies and improved birth outcomes.","The candidate will be responsible for refining and validating the acquisition technique, which employs a radial acquisition with a continuous radiofrequency shift (aka SWEEP) to create multi-slice, flow sensitive data. The candidate will also optimize a reconstruction pipeline (in Python) for these unique data.
 
Initial tests of accuracy and feasibility will be performed on an MRI compatible, programmable flow pump system (CardioFlow 5000, Shelley Medical Inc) and on healthy adult subjects. Once validated, the technique will be applied to healthy, late gestation (>35 wks) pregnant subjects.
 
Innovative aspects of this work will include MRI pulse sequence development, reconstruction of undersampled (i.e. sub-Nyquist) non-Cartesian MRI acquisitions, and analysis of multi- dimensional blood flow data.","The candidate should be adept at image and signal processing (or, ideally, have previous experience working with MRI data), and have experience with programming in Python.","Targeted Clusters

Preferably, someone with knowledge of Golang and Ruby, but knowledge of Python and Java is also desired. Our team is looking for a future Developer who wants to focus on building tools that change the way organisations think about data.

At ThinkData, we don't want to put you in a box before you get here. We are looking for people who are passionate about programming and who love learning and using new tools and languages. If you are a skilled developer, we will use your strengths to grow our platform, deepen your experience, and offer the best data management services available.

What's in it for you?
The chance to make an impact. You will be empowered to make decisions and make a difference as a member of the team. Students are as part of the team as any other Full-Time employee. 
Access to new tech. At ThinkData we don't shy away from bleeding edge tech. We encourage you to experiment, test and push the boundaries through research and development.
New builds. You will utilize open source tech to help build new, unique product features, addressing change requests and incorporating user feedback into the product roadmap.
A clean slate. We have new ideas to develop and we are open to new concepts. This is a chance to help develop products and APIs on a virtual blank page and introduce your own ideas for future products.
A dynamic environment. We are a startup that works with enterprise companies. That means complex challenges that are continuously changing. It's projects that quickly evolve as we respond to the demands of the environment and innovate to solve problems that might not even exist yet.

About Us
ThinkData Works, Inc. is a Toronto-based technology startup whose data management platform, Namara, is used by some of the foremost organizations in the world to process and refine data into usable products. We host one of the largest repositories of publicly available data and enable our clients to significantly increase the amount of information they use to fuel solutions.
At ThinkData, our mission is to build the easiest and most secure solution that enables our users to access, integrate, and collaborate on the data that powers their business. Some of the largest companies in the world, from tech to banking and beyond, use our platform. 

We're not a single-solution AI company or a consulting firm disguised as a startup. We're interested in solving the fundamental problem of accessing and distributing data. Namara as a data management platform will propel the next wave of intelligent solutions.

Need more reasons to join?
We may be technologically driven, but like every Canadian, we know the best ideas are thought of up north in a cottage. During the summer, we take the whole team on a 3-day retreat for vision-setting, aligning our goals, product management, and team-building. We're not saying this involves guitars, and songs by the campfire. But we're not saying it doesn't.
We are managing our growth. We continue to promote and nurture the open, collaborative nature of who we are and how we work. We work hard while still having fun, being ourselves, hanging out together, and enjoying delicious snacks at the office. 
And we don't just support each other in the office. The number of musicians in-house is pretty overwhelming, from 90s cover bands to death metal. There's always a co-worker with a gig coming up and we love to go out and cheer them on.

One final note before applying
ThinkData Works prides itself for its diversity and being an equal opportunity employer. We welcome and encourage applications from people with disabilities. Accommodations are available on request for candidates taking part in all aspects of the selection process.
We value all of our applicants, but due to the high volume of applications we receive, only those selected for an interview will be contacted.

Geoffrey the A.I. delivery bot,  is named after computer scientist Geoffrey ""the godfather of machine learning"" Hinton.  Robot Geoffrey has been turning heads in downtown Toronto over the past few months simply by traversing city sidewalks

The goal is to eventually swap many cars for many little robots that can deliver food within a one-mile range in just 15 minutes by travelling at speeds of up to 6 km/h.  Not only would such a system reduce C02 emissions, it would allow people who normally couldn't afford restaurant delivery to access pre-made food and spend their time in other ways.

							",4 month work term,"This is an opportunity in the exciting and fast-growing transportation technology industry. Public transit is being transformed from a system of static, scheduled fixed-routes, to a dynamic on-demand network, and you'll be one of the pioneers shaping this transformation.

As Business Analyst, you'll be responsible for analyzing transportation operations data, performing service design, running simulations, assessing key performance indicators, supporting new service launches, driving operational improvements, and providing technical systems support. You will develop an understanding of urban mobility challenges faced by transit operators. You will become proficient with RideCo's technology platform and data-driven design and operation of transportation services. As a technical and analytics resource for operations managers, you'll have an important role in shaping the design, performance, and success of our clients' next-generation on-demand transportation services.

Who we are:
http://www.rideco.com
RideCo powers on-demand transit. Public transit agencies use RideCo's cloud-based software platform to provide on-demand shared rides in dynamically routed buses, vans, and cars. Our clients include some of the world's largest transportation operators such as Grab, San Antonio Metro, Los Angeles Metro, San Diego County, and Calgary Transit.

Have you experienced getting frustrated with transfers and waiting while taking a public bus? Have you seen buses drive around in low-density areas with very few passengers on-board and wondered how inefficient that seems to be? You're likely aware of the first & last mile access challenges faced by transit hubs. We are solving these problems by re-imagining shared mobility. Imagine a world where vehicles have dynamic routes responsive to real-time trip demand. This 'dynamic shuttle' (or van /sedan) would pick you up, on-demand, at or near your doorstep and take you to your destination or transit hub. Along the way, it may pick-up other passengers going in your direction. Your experience will be seamless: less waiting, less walking, fewer transfers, shorter travel time, and timely pickups and drop-offs. RideCo's 'dynamic shuttle' platform enables this seamless experience and low-cost shared rides for vehicle fleet operators and their passengers. By seamlessly moving more people in fewer vehicles we are catalyzing a generational shift in how people get around cities and towns. This means commuters spend less time in transit and more time doing what they enjoy.

RideCo powers a diverse range of use cases, including residential/ suburban travel; first-mile-last-mile connections for transit hubs; and corporate employee transportation. We are investing to scale up and capture the growing demand for on-demand shared rides solutions.","During your work term, your day-to-day responsibilities will include:

- Generate and analyze operational performance reports: Build comprehensive performance analysis reports spanning rider user-experience, driver user-experience, operating efficiency, and unit economics. Compare the performance against goals, evaluate trends, and identify areas for improvement.
- Run simulations and optimize service design: Perform simulations to analyze performance and operational KPIs. Iterate on the service model by tuning and optimizing dozens of parameters such as dynamic routing engine settings, vehicle count and mix, service frequency, location and density of potential stops, and demand models.
- Support new service launches: Support operations managers during the launch process, including monitoring KPIs on launch week and making system changes as needed.
- Provide systems support: Provide ongoing technical systems and analytics support to operations managers. Advise them on using the system's dashboards and interpreting the data. Perform system configuration changes based on feedback from operations staff, drivers, and passengers.
- Improve internal processes and tooling: Identify ways to further automate and systematize our internal processes, including with new analysis and visualization tools. Share your ideas with team members and collaboratively champion internal process/tooling improvements.
- Help build proposals for new projects and prospective clients.","- Major in Math/Business/Economics 
- A cumulative average of greater than 70% 
- Proficient with Microsoft Excel and pivot tables

Modeled after the United Kingdom's Behavioural Insights Team, the BIU operates as an internal consultancy and works across a variety of exciting policy domains.

Overall, you will be helping to ensure that the Ontario Public Service relies on the best possible evidence, and maintains a relentless focus on the needs and perspectives of users. You will be a champion for innovative, people-centred approaches across government.

Student job title:
     REMOTE - Junior Data Scientist
 
Name of project:
     Deep Learning for Event Reconstruction in Water Cherenkov Detectors
 
Overview:
     Neutrino oscillations are the only experimentally verified observation
     of a process not described by the Standard Model of particle physics.
     Since their discovery in 1998 we have learnt a lot about the
     parameters that govern these oscillations, but there are still many
     questions remaining. Perhaps the most exciting of these is to
     determine whether neutrino oscillations violate charge-parity (CP)
     symmetry, and so could potentially explain why we live in a
     matter-dominated universe.
     The T2K experiment and Nobel prize-winning Super-Kamiokande experiment
     are powerful tools for exploring neutrino oscillations. The next
     generation Hyper-Kamiokande experiment, coming online in the middle of
     the decade, has significant discovery potential for CP violation, as
     well as other phenomena such as proton decay, supernovae and other
     multi-messenger astronomical events, and dark matter. The Canadian
     group is working on a number of interesting R&D efforts aimed towards
     maximizing the potential of Hyper-K.
    
     A background and a source of major systematic uncertainty in the CP
     violation analysis is caused by events where a gamma ray is produced
     in a neutrino interaction instead of the usual charged lepton
     (electron). Supervised deep learning techniques such as Convolutional
     Neural Networks and PointNets have been developed within the research
     group and incorporation of these methods in a statistical analysis is
     being developed currently to estimate to what precision Neutral
     Current gamma interaction rate (cross-section) could be measured.
     Another class of background events is present when a neutral pion
     (pi0) is produced. Typically these types of events result in a
     double-ring topology. Current effort within the group concentrates on
     panoptic segmentation of the event data to distinguish multiple
     Cherenkov rings. During the course of the project the student will
     develop one-shot classification method for the pi0 events and a method
     based on prior segmentation of the event and evaluate performance of
     the alternatives. Time permitting, generative deep learning methods
     can be applied to limit the impact of systematic effects or to improve
     the classifier training process. Such methods will include Generative
     Adversarial Networks (GANs) and their variants such as CycleGANs. The
     successful completion of the project will have a substantial impact on
     key scientific goals of both the Super-K and Hyper-K experiment, such
     as the CP violation measurement and other areas of particle physics
     and astronomy.","Duties:
     Major duties include:
     - Development and tuning of deep learning models for analysis of water
     Cherenkov data.
    
     - Development and deployment of statistical data analysis tools.","Skills learned during this work experience:
     - Experience in many aspects of a complicated physics problem. This
     will range from low level understanding of photosensors to the
     description of the high level capabilities of a next-generation
     neutrino experiment.
     - Machine learning concepts and experience with deep learning
     libraries such as pytorch
    
     - Experience with generative deep learning methods
    
     - Critical thinking and problem solving
    
     - Presentation skills from reports in regular meetings at national and
     international levels                                                 

Qualifications:
     We are looking for a motivated physics student to work on an exciting
     high-energy physics project. The core skills that we are looking for
     include:
     - Strong competence in the use of computational methods for data
     analysis.

     - Experience with using Linux OS.
    
     - Python programming experience.

     - Ability to independently solve problems and investigate

     - Understanding of the basics of a particle physics detector.
    
     - Understanding of concepts in probability theory and statistics.
    
     - C++ programming experience

Overview:
     ALPHA-Canada is  an experimental collaboration between a number of
     Canadian universities and laboratories (UBC, Calgary, SFU, TRIUMF,
     York), Our new initiative HAICU is aiming to develop a next-generation
     apparatus to precisely probe the properties of anithydrogen and
     hydrogen atoms in a free-falling fountain. The apparatus first
     prepares the (anti-)atoms in a small, high-gradient magnetic trap,
     decreases their energy with Doppler laser cooling, then transfers them
     to a magnetic trap with lower gradient and larger volume. This
     expansion adiabatically cools the (anti-)atoms far below the Doppler
     cooling limit. The (anti-)atoms are then launched into a region free
     from any magnetic perturbation, and various coherent quantum
     techniques can be used to precisely measure the properties of the
     (anti-)atoms during the subsequent free-fall. These techniques include
     Raman interferometry, used to measure gravitational acceleration, and
     Ramsey interferometry, used to measure transition frequencies.","Duties:
     The student will work remotely with ALPHA scientists to refine
     numerical models used to simulate the behaviour of (anti-)atoms in the
     magnetic trap. The models include a magnetic field interpolator, used
     to propagate field from a pre-computed grid to the position of
     individual particles, and a particle pusher, used to evolve particle
     position using the field. The student will evaluate the precision of
     both models as a function of computational and memory cost, and
     introduce refinements where applicable.","Skills learned during this work experience:

     REMOTE or ON-SITE - Simulations and experiment development for the
     TRIUMF UCN source and TUCAN EDM
 
Name of project:
     Simulations and experiment development for the TRIUMF UCN source and
     the neutron EDM project
 
Overview:
     Knowledge of fundamental properties of the neutron helps to understand
     many aspects of the universe. It all starts right after the Big Bang:
     matter wins over antimatter in the universe, making our existence
     possible. One essential ingredient for this matter-antimatter
     asymmetry is violation of a more fundamental symmetry, called CP
     violation. This, in turn might show up in a non-zero electric dipole
     moment (EDM) of the neutron, making EDM measurements the flagship of
     fundamental neutron physics.
     About 100 s after the Big Bang, the relevance of the neutron
     properties continues: neutron beta-decay lifetime plays an important
     role in primordial nucleosynthesis, influencing, e.g., the helium
     abundance in the Universe significantly. If neutron lifetime results
     are combined with experiments determining other decay parameters of
     the neutron, important coupling constants of the weak interaction of
     fundamental particles can be determined.These are important for our
     understanding of solar models and tests of the Standard Model of
     particle physics.
     Owing to its neutrality and long lifetime of around 15 min, one can
     also look very carefully at the gravitational interaction of neutrons,
     thus probing the quantum mechanical features of the gravity potential;
     in turn, this puts constraints on non-Newtonian gravity models.
     All the experiments above have in common the need for very slow
     neutrons, called ultra-cold neutrons (UCN). We are presently building
     a new UCN source driving TRIUMF's new UCN facility. Opportunities
     exist for an undergraduate student to contribute in a significant way
     to the electric dipole moment experiment or the UCN facility start-up.","Duties:
     The student will work on simulations of ultracold neutrons in magnetic
     and electric fields and on the design of the high-voltage cell for the
     neutron EDM experiment. This work will be carried out in a team
     environment with physicists and graduate students from TRIUMF and the
     Universities of British Columbia (UBC), Winnipeg (UW), Manitoba (UM),
     Osaka (RCNP) and Tokio (KEK).","Skills learned during this work experience:
     For the particle simulation tasks the student will get familiar with
     Monte Carlo methods and particle spin-tracking. During the
     experimental and design tasks skills learned will be related to vacuum
     techniques, cryogenics, high-voltage and neutron depolarization
     requirements for the neutron EDM experiment.
     Additionally, participation in our weekly international status
     meetings for the UCN source and EDM experiment is highly recommended
     for the student to get introduced into the international
     collaboration.
     We are providing a stimulating environment for students to learn new
     things while contributing significantly to the progress of the
     project.                                                             

Qualifications:
     Third or Fourth year physics, engineering (Eng.Phys.) with some
     experimental experience. Experience using CAD software (ideally
     SolidWorks) is recommended. Some experience using FEA software (e.g.
     ANSYS, Opera, FEMM) and C++ (or equivalent) and working in a
     Linux-based environment would be advantageous for the simulation work.
     Affinity for experimental techniques and development is what we are
     looking for in an ideal candidate.

Name of project:
     Geometrical Calibration of Water Cherenkov Detectors Using
     Photogrammetry
 
Overview:
     Neutrino oscillations are the only experimentally verified observation
     of a process not described by the Standard Model (SM) of particle
     physics. Since their discovery in 1998 we have learnt a lot about the
     parameters that govern these oscillations, but there are still many
     questions remaining. Perhaps the most exciting of these is to
     determine whether neutrino oscillations violate charge-parity (CP)
     symmetry, and so could potentially explain why we live in a
     matter-dominated universe.
    
     The T2K experiment and Nobel prize-winning Super-Kamiokande experiment
     are powerful tools for exploring neutrino oscillations. The next
     generation Hyper-Kamiokande experiment, coming online in the middle of
     next decade, has significant discovery potential for CP violation, as
     well as other phenomenon such as proton decay, supernovae and other
     multi-messenger astronomical events, and dark matter. The Canadian
     group is working on a number of interesting R&D efforts aimed towards
     maximizing the potential of Hyper-K.
     Super-K, Hyper-K, and other interim detectors we are developing,
     employ a large array of very sensitive single-photon sensors to
     observe Cherenkov light emanating from particles produced by a
     neutrino interaction or other event like proton decay. A precise
     knowledge of the relative positioning of all the photosensors and
     calibration sources in the detector is necessary to achieve accurate
     reconstruction of a particle's energy and direction, key parameters in
     a neutrino oscillation measurement. The goal of this particular
     project is to develop a photogrammetry technique for determining the
     positions of photosensors in Super-K and eventually Hyper-K (and its
     intermediate detector). This technique has not yet been widely
     successfully applied to this class of detectors and would be a
     significant innovation in the field, achieving the most precise
     understanding of such a detector to date.","Duties:
     You will be involved in developing a photogrammetry technique, from
     hardware and operations, to software and analysis. We are evaluating
     and characterizing underwater camera systems and remote operated
     vehicles (ROV) for deployment in Super-K and Hyper-K. Your tasks will
     involve:
    
     - Designing, assembling, testing, and calibrating underwater camera
     systems (may be able to be done on-site, or remotely if local)
     - Operation and calibration of an ROV (may be able to be done on UBC Campus)
     - Photogrammetry analysis for camera calibration, feature recognition,
     and distance measurements
     - Develop improvements in feature recognition algorithms, including
     machine learning (semantic segmentation) applications
     - Compare measurements to known distances to determine accuracy of
     your algorithms
     - Analysis of images taken with the ROV in the Super-K detector
     - Implementation of results in water Cherenkov detector simulation and
     Monte Carlo studies of the effects.","Skills learned during this work experience:
     - Photography and optics
     - Hardware design and assembly
     - Operation of underwater ROV
     - Critical thinking and problem solving
     - Software and algorithm development, including application of machine
     learning
     - Analysis of data and assessment of statistical and systematic
     uncertainties
     - High-performance cluster computing, big data analysis
     - Presentation skills from reports in regular meetings at national and
     international levels                                                 
 
Qualifications:
     We are looking for a motivated physics or engineering student to work

     are looking for include:
    
     - Careful control and attention to detail in laboratory experiments,
     hardware and electronics projects
    
     - Strong competence in the use of computers for serious analysis.
     - Ability to quickly learn several new computer tools and software

Student job title:
     ON-SITE: Atom trap for beta decay Research Assistant
 
Name of project:
     Nuclear beta decay: particle physics with atom traps
 
Overview:
     We have completed the most accurate beta decay asymmetry ever
     measured, by measuring the difference in number of betas emitted with
     and against the nuclear spin direction. This is the observable first
     used by Wu et al. in 1957 to discover that parity symmetry is violated
     by the weak interaction.  We have improved their experiment by an
     order of magnitude using an atom trap, using the absorption of
     circularly polarized light to both spin-polarize the atoms and measure
     the achieved polarization.
      We have also made first tests of time-reversal breaking in radiative
     beta decay, adding gamma-ray detection.
      We are upgrading these experiments to do better, and want to improve
     both the degree of spin polarization, and how well we measure it. To
     prepare to do this with radioactive atoms which require rare beamtime
     from the main cyclotron, we must do several technical tasks with
     readily available stable atoms, including improving the sensitivity of
     the atomic probes.  Depending on student interest and experience, this
     term may include gamma-ray detector development, in addition to the
     optical probes.
    
     Pandemic protocols: This research would be about 2 days/week at
     TRIUMF, with all planning, design, and analysis done from home. The
     position may not allow any additional travel from outside BC. The
     on-site research will follow the ALARA (exposure As Low as Reasonably
     Achievable) principle borrowed from radiation safety.","Duties:
     1 to 2 of the following tasks, depending on student experience and
     interest: Couple an ultraviolet laser into an optical fiber to
     photoionize and probe atoms.  Improve understanding of direct optical
     probes of the atomic polarization. Help with development of gamma-ray
     scintillation detector with SiPM readout.","Skills learned during this work experience:
     UV laser alignment and triggering, control programming, gamma-ray
     detection.
 
Qualifications:
     Physics or Engineering Physics student preferred. Optics course and/or
     lab would be an asset. Electronics lab with equivalent of Horowitz and
     Hill would be an asset. Some quantum mechanics would be helpful to
     understand the atom trapping. C++ programming would be an asset.

Name of project:
     Particle Reconstruction and Identification via Deep Learning with the
     ATLAS Detector
 
Overview:
     Proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva,
     Switzerland produce hundreds of particles that are recorded by the
     ATLAS detector. The ATLAS detector uses a variety of detector
     technologies to measure and identify these particles, and currently
     hand-designed algorithms are used to combine inputs from each
     detector. TRIUMF, in collaboration with other laboratories, is
     currently leading a new effort to instead use deep learning techniques
     to combine these measurements and use the best information possible to
     improve the efficiency of identification and the resolution of energy
     measurements. This project will focus on developing techniques using
     convolutional and graph neural networks to devise these new
     reconstruction strategies and quantify the performance improvements of
     these techniques. These studies can lead to a substantial improvement
     in ATLAS's ability to interpret its data and identify signatures of
     physics beyond the Standard Model.","Duties:
     The selected student will analyze simulated data and potentially
     recorded collisions produced by the ATLAS Collaboration. The student
     will develop workflows to analyze the data, and to combine disparate
     detector technologies in single datasets. The student will develop
     deep learning models to combine information from different detectors,
     and will quantify the efficiency of reconstruction and the accuracy of
     energy regression. The student will regularly report in ATLAS-TRIUMF
     group meetings, and in broader ATLAS meetings.
     This project is expected to be fully remote.","Skills learned during this work experience:
     Students will learn to utilize modern data-science analysis workflows
     such as Pandas and TensorFlow in Python, as well as frameworks
     utilizing ROOT in C++. They will learn the detailed properties of
     particle detectors such as trackers and calorimeters, and the relative
     qualities of these detectors in the ATLAS experiment. They will learn
     how to quantify the performance of a detector in the complicated
     environment of hadron colliders. Students will learn to present their
     work to collaborators and broader audiences.
 
Qualifications:
     Students should have familiarity with particle physics at the
     undergraduate level. Experience with programming, especially in C++
     and Python, is an advantage. Experience with particle detectors (in
     class, or previous research experience, etc.) is an advantage.
     Familiarity with modern analysis packages (Pandas, etc.) and machine
     learning is a plus. Third year students and above are preferred, but
     exceptional students at younger years will be considered.

Name of project:
     Field compensation study for the TRIUMF cyclotron horizontal injection
     section
 
Overview:
     The TRIUMF 500 MeV cyclotron is the workhorse of the laboratory
     producing a variety of beams for science and applications. The
     cyclotron relies on the electrostatic injection beam line to maintain
     its availability above 90%. The injection line can be divided into two
     main sections: the horizontal and the vertical. The vertical section
     has been replaced a few years ago, but the horizontal is still the
     original one in service now for almost 50 years. In order to maintain
     reliability and reduce maintenance, the horizontal section needs to be
     replaced; this is an approved project (P481) that has been initiated
     and must be completed in this 2020-25 five-year cycle. One aspect to
     address in the design of the new horizontal injection section is the
     compensation of the cyclotron stray magnetic field (that is presently
     accomplished in a passive mode with soft steel enclosures and
     permanent magnets); the first step requires to map the stray magnetic
     field at the horizontal section level in order to properly design the
     new compensation system.","Duties:
     Working with the P481 project team to characterize the stray magnetic
     field along the horizontal injection beamline and study potential
     compensation systems (passive vs active); duties include:
     - Measuring the stray magnetic field from Ion source terminal two (I2)
     to the first horizontal 90-deg. bend section.
     - Measuring the stray magnetic field from the second horizontal
     90-deg. bend section to the 90-deg. vertical bend section of the
     injection line.
     - Modelling compensation schemes in OPERA: active (Helmholtz-type
     coils) and passive (soft steel shielding)
     - Recording the magnetic field survey and draft a report.
     - Additional/optional scope: prototyping and characterization of
     compensation systems.","Skills learned during this work experience:
     - Acquire knowledge in magnetic fields, and in particular gain
     experience in magnetic field measurements

Overview:
     TRIUMF is Canada's national laboratory for particle and nuclear
     physics and accelerator-based science. Our 500 MeV cyclotron provides
     the proton driver beams for the majority of TRIUMF's current on-site
     research programs, which include molecular and materials science and
     nuclear medicine, physics and astrophysics. There are two ISOL
     (Isotope Separator On-Line) facilities on-site. The ISAC facility has
     been producing and accelerating radioactive ion beams with the highest
     power driver beam in the world since 1999. The Advanced Rare IsotopE
     Laboratory (ARIEL) is currently under development and will expand
     TRIUMF's (and Canada's) capabilities to produce and study radioactive
     isotopes for cutting edge research. There will be two new driver
     beam?target interaction stations for the production of exotic isotopes
     at ARIEL, the first accepting a 100 kW, 35 MeV electron driver beam
     and the second accepting a 50 kW, 500 MeV proton driver beam. The
     ARIEL test stands are a critical step in the design process of the
     ARIEL target stations, since our group relies on off-line development
     to validate designs and troubleshoot problems before they are
     committed to an on-line installation. This development is done
     primarily on test stands which are modular and undergo frequent
     upgrades. The test stands also provide the opportunity for the
     development of new ideas and techniques, which translate directly into
     better operation of TRIUMF's radioactive ion beam facilities. The
     Target and Ion Source Acceptance (TISA) test stand is on the ARIEL
     Electron Target East (AETE) target station critical path and is
     scheduled to enter operation in 2021. To achieve this, all the
     required mechanical and electrical systems must be installed and
     validated. These systems will include high voltage, signal processing,
     high pressure actuation, vacuum, electrical and mechanical tasks.
     Documentation of all tests performed will also be required.","Duties:

     TISA front end. This includes HV testing and electrical service
     delivery. Support for this will include setup, wiring, following a
     test plan, general engineering simulation/calculation support and
     documentation.
     The student will also provide assistance during mechanical testing of
     the TISA front end. This may include continuing previous work to
     facilitate alignment calculations of the position of the front end,
     and continuing work to validate the high pressure piston coupling
     system.","Skills learned during this work experience:
     The student will learn a variety of skills related to high voltage,
     vacuum, electrical and high pressure systems. They will also develop
     skills related to simulation, calculation, engineering design and
     presentation. They will work with a wide range of professionals which
     will help them develop a complete understanding of the engineering

     and cutting-edge new technologies in nuclear medicine.  One of our
     major research efforts is to develop and test novel chelates to
     harness the powerful radionuclides for cancer diagnosis and treatment,
     i.e. targeted radionuclide therapy. The chelates under development in
     our labs have been successfully used to label therapeutical isotopes
     such as Ac-225, Lu-177, and others. When conjugated with a targeting
     vector, the radiopharmaceuticals demonstrated tumor-specific
     accumulation in several preclinical studies.","Duties:
     The successful candidate will join the effort of developing the next
     generation radiopharmaceuticals for targeted radionuclide therapy.
     She/He will take part in the organic synthesis, characterization, and
     radiolabelling and also participate in the in vitro and in vivo
     evaluation.","Skills learned during this work experience:
     Hands-on knowledge and experience with organic synthesis, analysis,
     radiochemistry, and chemical biology will be learned.  Basic knowledge
     in radiopharmaceutical sciences and radiotracer development will be
     acquired.  Documentation and presentation skills will be practiced.
 
Qualifications:

Student job title:
     REMOTE - Undergraduate Research Assistant
 
Name of project:
 Trigger optimization for selection of Higgs Boson pair events with the ATLAS Detector.
 
Overview:
     After the discovery of the Higgs boson by the ATLAS and CMS
     collaborations in 2012, the observation of a simultaneous two Higgs
     production (di-Higgs) at the LHC is now gaining a constantly growing
     attention in High Energy Physics research due to its potential to
     unveil important questions about cosmology and physics Beyond the
     Standard Model (BSM). However, the future increase in the number of
     simultaneous proton-proton collisions at the LHC will make the
     selection of di-Higgs signals complicated due to the difficulty of the
     ATLAS Trigger and Data Acquisition system (TDAQ) to cope with such a
     high event rate. An update of the ATLAS multi-jet trigger strategy
     will then be essential to maintain the selection of double-Higgs
     events decaying to four b-jets (HH-->4b) high and enhance the
     sensitivity of the ATLAS detector to new physics in this signature.
     This project will explore the potential of novel calorimeter-based
     techniques for the selection of Higgs candidates in multi-jet
     high-pileup events, targeting improvements in the selection of HH-->4b
     signals and possibly resulting in an important update of the next
     ATLAS trigger strategy for this signature.","Duties:
     The selected student will analyze simulated data and potentially
     recorded collisions produced by the ATLAS Collaboration. The student
     will develop workflows to analyze the data, and devise selection
     strategies to select signal and remove background events. The student
     will assess the selection efficiency of these strategies, and their
     suitability for integration into the ATLAS trigger system. The student
     will regularly report in ATLAS-TRIUMF group meetings, and in broader
     ATLAS meetings.
     This position is expected to be fully remote.","Skills learned during this work experience:
     Students will learn to utilize simulated data from the ATLAS detector
     using Python and C++ using ROOT and other frameworks. They will learn
     the detailed properties of particle detectors such as trackers and
     calorimeters and how they are utilized in trigger decisions made by
     the detector. Students will learn to present their work to
     collaborators and broader audiences.
 
Qualifications:
     Students should have familiarity with particle physics at the
     undergraduate level. Experience with programming, especially in C++
     and Python, is an advantage. Experience with particle detectors (in
     class, or previous research experience, etc.) is an advantage. Third
     year students and above are preferred, but exceptional students at
     younger years will be considered.

The NiMBaL Lab conducts several research projects in collaboration with the Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative (ONDRI) (http://ondri.ca). ONDRI's objective is to improve the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). ONDRI's first large-scale study was a longitudinal cohort study capturing data from hundreds of patients across multiple assessment domains including: gait and balance, neuroimaging, neuropsychology, clinical, eye-tracking, genetics, and spectral domain optical coherence tomography. The NiMBaL lab co-leads the collection and analysis of ONDRI gait and balance data.
In 2018, the NiMBaL lab began leading a new ONDRI research initiative focused on monitoring health behaviors outside of the clinic in the home and community (ONDRI@Home). The goals of ONDRI@Home are to: translate clinical assessments into feasible, technology-based, free-living assessments completed outside of the clinic in the person's home environment. Secondly, to identify measures capable of improving diagnoses and monitoring of people with NDD. A unique challenge of the @Home project is the need to manage large volumes of data, captured from multiple sensors, measuring many behaviors over multiple days.

What you'll do:
As the Outreach and Recruitment Associate, you're part of a small but energetic team who works with prospective students to determine if St. Jerome's University is where they want to live, study, and grow. You'll be responsible for planning and implementing outreach and recruitment activities such as You@Waterloo Day, (virtual) campus tours, (online) school visits, TikTok videos, and/or Instagram Stories. You'll also be working with student leaders and staff to oversee the Ambassador Program, and you'll be interacting with future students to answer their questions live, on the phone, through e-mail, and over various interactive web platforms (such as blogs, the SJU website, social media, etc.). It's a fast-paced, people-first environment with multiple projects on the go at any given time through which you will actively contribute to bringing in the next cohort of St. Jerome's University students at the University of Waterloo. Your suggestions, ideas, and innovations are encouraged and empowered as a member of this team.","A typical day may look like:
- Take, edit, and create photos, videos, and other visual content that can be added to various web platforms (such as what activities students have planned for the summer, including exciting co-ops!).
- Call back a parent of a prospective student who has questions about co-registration between SJU and Waterloo.
- Eat your lunch while playing our classic ""SJU Stay at Home Trivia"" with staff, faculty, and students.
- Attend a Recruitment Roundtable meeting and share your ideas in preparation for You@Waterloo Day.
- Analyze statistics you gathered in a survey of why current students chose to study at SJU and/or live at SJU.
- Reach out to a Professor in the English Department at SJU to do a quick interview about the exciting online lessons and course they are planning for the Fall (and so you can share it on social media!)
- Partner with the Student Affairs team to create off-campus (online) social events for continuing students 
- Join staff and faculty as they come together (on Zoom) for a weekly coffee time on Friday mornings. A great opportunity to get to know the people that you work alongside!","This position might be right for you if:
- Your calendar is detailed and colour-coordinated, and you've already mapped out what your next two weeks look like.
- You love having friends over and making sure they have all the food and comfort they need to enjoy themselves.
- You're an enthusiastic member of a team, able to take charge and stand in the spotlight, but are also just as happy to ensure everything is running smoothly behind the scenes.
- You thrive by helping people and by going that extra mile to make sure their interaction with you is a memorable one.
- You love social media and might spend more time that you'd like to admit out loud posting, retweeting, and scrolling through endless TikTok videos.
- You're a self-motivated self-starter who takes initiative to dive into new projects without being asked.
- You are passionate about digital design and digital communication and like creating and editing videos, graphics, and creative content.
- You think creatively and outside the box, but you also know how to pay attention to details and stay focused on your priorities.
 
You might also stand out if you have:
- experience in recruitment, marketing, sales, and/or public speaking
- knowledge of St. Jerome's University and the University of Waterloo
- knowledge of the Kitchener-Waterloo region and culture
- creative skills in fine arts, digital media, photography/video making, and/or writing

Why SJU?
Every day we put ourselves in the shoes of our future students to go where they are, understand their needs and wants, and make standard what our competitors consider above and beyond. We challenge ourselves to be 1% better tomorrow than we are today, and we rely on each other to guide and to give that extra push when needed. At the end of the day, we want to raise the profile of the university, and we want to create memorable moments and lasting relationships with our current and future students.
