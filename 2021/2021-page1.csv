You'll be immersed in a startup's entrepreneurial environment where things move quickly, and you'll be working directly with our lead developer to make additions to our best-selling Learning Management System for WordPress. 


This position comes with a lot of responsibility, because every new feature and improvement is used by literally hundreds of thousands of end users across the WordPress platform.  


Beyond the numbers, there's a lot to be excited about: 


We believe that access to education can help defy stereotypes and make the world a better place, while providing a sustainable livelihood for enterprising teachers. 


If you're interested in making the world of online learning more fun and successful for both students and course creators, then keep reading.","As a full stack developer, you'll experience every part of the design and development lifecycle. AccessAlly is a PHP plugin for the WordPress platform, which powers over 35% of all websites on the internet. 


You'll also learn a lot about email marketing automation platforms, payment gateways, and other WordPress plugins and themes in the ecosystem that integrate with AccessAlly. 


Some of the things you might be expected to take charge of include: 


* Implementing UI designs using a combination of PHP, JavaScript, and CSS 

* Participating in development sprints to create new features 

* Fixing bugs and issues as they arise 

* Supporting the release cycle to get the software to our clients on time 

* Creating regression testing and unit tests to ensure only quality code ships 

* Report on your progress and demonstrate new features to the team 

* Document your development work and create tutorials or associated training 

* Integrating AccessAlly with new email platforms like Mailchimp, AWeber, MailerLite, etc. 

* Working as an integral part of the team to create and provide support for software our clients love 


You'll be asked to work independently with minimal daily oversight, while also contributing to and collaborating with a close-knit team. 


As a member of the development team, you may be asked to troubleshoot issues that get escalated from the client support team, but you won't be on the front lines of customer support. That means you get to focus on your zone of genius, and ship more code instead of getting bogged down by customers' questions.","Qualities and skills we're looking for: 


* Enrollment in a Computer Science, Mathematics, Engineering degree or similar program 

* Have experience in a full stack engineering role 

* Demonstrate a practical understanding of Web APIs, PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 

* Have practical experience with relational databases, SQL and engines like PostgreSQL and MySQL 

* Understanding of website hosting server technology, including caching functionalities 

* Familiarity with the free WordPress platform and general understanding of the plugins ecosystem 

* Self-starting, highly motivated 

* Ability to take direction and feedback and iterate toward shared goals with grace 

* Excellent writing and interpersonal skills

ActiveState Platform - made by developers for developers! At ActiveState, we are reinventing package management with an on-demand SaaS Platform and CLI tool that lets developers automate the building of any runtime environment using any open-source language ecosystem on any platform. In Beta right now, we support Python and Perl and we're hiring to add more languages and packages! We're building an ambitious language distribution platform so that no engineer ever has to suffer dependency hell again, and we need your help to expand it! 


This position is remote due to the current health situation and can be done from your location of choice anywhere in Canada.  

This position is open to applicants who are eligible for ActiveState's Intern Program. The rate for this position will be commensurate with your experience.


Our team is scattered around the US and Canada, so we coordinate with each other and the rest of the company using Slack for chat, Zoom for video calls and screen sharing, Pivotal Tracker, and Google Drive. 

  

We like to use open-source software whenever possible, and we also like to contribute back to the open-source ecosystem. We embrace open sourcing both libraries and tools developed in-house. 

  

Working at ActiveState 

ActiveState has a collaborative, respectful, and professional culture. We're all about working together to find the best solutions and making sure that the experience of doing so is positive for everyone involved. There is a commitment from the CEO on down to making work at ActiveState a great experience for all of us. 

  

Our company is a team of 68+ and growing, with 2/3rds of the positions in technical roles including software development and QA. We maintain a set of core, overlapping hours, but we're flexible with specific start and end times and are understanding about appointments and life events. 

  

Our vision is to have an ActiveState solution on every device on every planet, so we certainly don't lack ambition! But even though we're ambitious we don't expect work to become your life. We know you will do your best work in a positive environment free from death marches. For more about working at ActiveState and our Glassdoor rating go to www.activestate.com/careers. 

  

What's in it for You
 

Working for a stable and growing company that offers the environment and personal growth potential of a start-up.
The chance to work with a smart, passionate team of people","What You'll Be Doing 

As an intern on one of our engineering teams, you will be writing software that builds other software. There are multiple teams you can intern with and get a chance to put your learnings to practice working on a real-world SaaS application that has to run at scale. We're on the hunt for interns with an interest in one or more of the following fields:
 

Developer Productivity - Do you like making tools? Enjoy helping other people solve problems? Appreciate saving millions of person-minutes of time every year? We're building CLI, web, and API tools to make development work easier and more fun.
Automation/DevOps - Most of the things in this area don't require an Advanced Degree in some esoteric part of the Computer Science field. We need people that have a couple languages under their belt (Python, Go, C/C++, Javascript, Perl, Ruby, PHP, etc...), love APIs, and desire to Automate all the Things. Bonus points if you find Docker, Kubernetes, Bazel, and the Cloud interesting!
Distributed Computing/Graph Algorithms - Are you fascinated by Consensus Algorithms like Paxos and Raft? Planning to do your thesis on possible solutions to the Split Brain or Byzantine Generals problem? We're Building the Build Farm to end all Build Farms and Parallel Computing to solve graph problems is critical to us.
Data Collection and Analysis - Our mission is to free the world from Dependency Hell for all Languages and Operating Systems. While Open Source Communities have started working on solutions to these problems, many times the only way to get software to work for your project is to carefully scrutinize a README or an online forum. We're consuming gobs of unstructured and under-specified data, analyzing it, and even training machines to do this work for us.
Open Source Programming Languages - Our business has long been working with open source languages such as Perl, Python, Tcl, Ruby, PHP, and Go. We're reinventing how teams and developers collaborate with these languages and their ecosystems. If you've built one or more of these languages from source and have contributed to PyPI, RubyGems, CPAN, or another repository, help us make developer lives better!

Our day-to-day work practices are centered around GitHub, pull requests, code review, CI for testing, and agile development. We're always looking to improve our practices and we expect you to help us to do so. 


**NB: As part of our interview process, we will be asking you to complete a small coding assignment which should take about 2 hours to complete. This will help to form part of the follow-up interview with our team. This will be discussed in the first video interview with you, but if you have any questions please feel free to ask during the first video interview.","Requirements
 

Experience with Linux, Window or Mac and the command line
Experience configuring and compiling open source software on at least one major platform (Windows, Mac, Linux)
Experience with text editors and/or IDEs
Experience programming in at least one of Perl, Python, or Ruby
Excellent written and spoken skills, both technical and non-technical. You'll need to work closely with your developer teammates, as well as be able to have coherent conversations with people from QA, sales, marketing, and other parts of the company.
A willingness to engage in the process of defining our work through conversations with product management, other engineering teams, and the rest of the company.

Assets 

If you have experience with any of the following please make sure to highlight it in your cover letter:
 

Relevant study, school projects, hobby projects, open source, or work experience related to the fields above or those you think are relevant to us.
Relevant study, school projects, hobby projects or work experience on a build system outside of an IDE.
