Hi, I'm Nathan, cofounder at Together Software. Learning at work is broken, especially at large or remote companies, and we're enabling peer to peer learning between employees to fix it. Organizations like the United Nations, Disney and 7-11 are already using us to run mentoring programs to up-skill their employees. Our investors are the same ones that invested in Slack, Coinbase, and Instacart. 


For example, the United Nations uses our product to connect employees from around the world to discuss how they should choose the next country to work in, how to get promoted faster, or what skills they need for their next job. We launched through Y Combinator in Summer 2019. 


Here's a few things you might be tasked with solving: 

- Can you engineer a product that will grow virally inside the organization (starts with 1 mentoring program and expands to all use-cases and all employees)? 

- Can you work with the rest of the team to create a defensible brand? 

- Can you help us hire the right team? We take hiring seriously and want to keep the dream team alive in engineering - we had only 2 engineers up until 50 customers!

TOOLBX Software Engineer Intern Winter 2022

We are excited to be launching our Co-op Winter Cohort 2022. You will be joining other co-op students and dig into some pretty awesome work to help our fast growing company expand across Canada and into the United States. As a Software Engineer Co-op, you will be a contributor to the design and implementation of technology projects that will drive the growth of the company. You will have the responsibility to execute on projects end to end with the guidance of an experienced software engineer. You will work across the full technology stack at TOOLBX as our projects span across the full stack of technologies from databases to mobile and web applications and other third-party services. 


Company Summary

TOOLBX is building a construction materials marketplace that connects top construction professionals with local retailers and suppliers. Our online platform makes it easy for builders to order and receive the materials they need to finish projects on-time and on-budget. With delivery as fast as two hours, TOOLBX has become a valuable tool for construction professionals that want to build faster, smarter and more efficiently. 

  

Here's why it matters:

We see an opportunity for small businesses to play alongside the larger organizations. Our platform brings the big and the small of the supply chain for construction together. Over half of the world's solid waste comes from building and construction. We see an opportunity to drive planned orders and an on-demand supply chain to support buying only when you need it. Most construction projects are either over budget or over time because contractors can't optimize their material spending and are slow to compile invoices. The most significant purchase for any individual or family will likely be their home. TOOLBX helps make construction projects more efficient. We're focused on material procurement, and we're still in the first inning. You could be one of the early people that shape our strategy","About The Role:

Write clean, robust code that scales across platforms and devices
Lead the design and implementation of new features for our platforms
Provide technical feedback to engineers through code reviews, design reviews, and team problem solving sessions
Collaborate with other members of the team to ensure the best possible outcome
Be able to work in an Agile environment","You will have:

Currently enrolled in Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, Engineering or an equivalent discipline
Passion for technology, change, and building an industry revolutionizing product

  

Nice to have

Solid understanding of modern JavaScript (ES6) and its ecosystem
Experience building React or React Native applications
Familiarity integrating with REST APIs and third-party services

RideCo powers on-demand transit. Public transit agencies use RideCo's cloud-based software platform to provide on-demand shared rides in dynamically routed buses, vans, and cars. Our clients include some of the world's largest transportation operators such as Grab, San Antonio Metro, Los Angeles Metro, San Diego County, and Calgary Transit. 


Have you experienced getting frustrated with transfers and waiting while taking a public bus? Have you seen buses drive around in low-density areas with very few passengers on-board and wondered how inefficient that seems to be? You're likely aware of the first & last mile access challenges faced by transit hubs. We are solving these problems by re-imagining shared mobility. Imagine a world where vehicles have dynamic routes responsive to real-time trip demand. This 'dynamic shuttle' (or van /sedan) would pick you up, on-demand, at or near your doorstep and take you to your destination or transit hub. Along the way, it may pick-up other passengers going in your direction. Your experience will be seamless: less waiting, less walking, fewer transfers, shorter travel time, and timely pickups and drop-offs. RideCo's 'dynamic shuttle' platform enables this seamless experience and low-cost shared rides for vehicle fleet operators and their passengers. By seamlessly moving more people in fewer vehicles we are catalyzing a generational shift in how people get around cities and towns. This means commuters spend less time in transit and more time doing what they enjoy. 


RideCo powers a diverse range of use cases, including residential/ suburban travel; first-mile-last-mile connections for transit hubs; and corporate employee transportation. We are investing to scale up and capture the growing demand for on-demand shared rides solutions.

     of a process not described by the Standard Model of particle physics. 

     Since their discovery in 1998 we have learnt a lot about the 

     parameters that govern these oscillations, but there are still many 

     questions remaining. Perhaps the most exciting of these is to 

     determine whether neutrino oscillations violate charge-parity (CP) 

     symmetry, and so could potentially explain why we live in a 

     matter-dominated universe. 

     

     The T2K experiment and Nobel prize-winning Super-Kamiokande experiment 

     are powerful tools for exploring neutrino oscillations. The next 

     generation Hyper-Kamiokande experiment, coming online in the middle of 

     the decade, has significant discovery potential for CP violation, as 

     well as other phenomena such as proton decay, supernovae and other 

     multi-messenger astronomical events, and dark matter. The Canadian 

     group is working on a number of interesting R&D efforts aimed towards 

     maximizing the potential of Hyper-K. 

     A background and a source of major systematic uncertainty in the CP 

     violation analysis is caused by events where a gamma ray or two are 

     produced in a neutrino interaction instead of the usual charged lepton 

     (signal electron). Supervised deep learning techniques such as 

     Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and PointNets have been developed 

     in-house for classification, and we are incorporating these methods in 

     a statistical analysis to estimate to what precision these backgrounds 

     could be measured and demonstrate improved background rejection. 

     These supervised algorithms are somewhat a blackbox and we wish to 

     develop panoptic segmentation to extract physical features (e.g. two 

     overlapping gamma rays) that can provide logical support to the CNN 

     predictions (i.e. opening the black box). Furthermore, the 

     segmentation of multiple particles can serve as an 

     auxiliary/intermediate task towards biasing classification and 

     regression for potentially improved performance. 

     Time permitting, generative deep learning methods can be applied to 

     limit the impact of systematic effects or to improve the classifier 

     training process. Such methods will include Generative Adversarial 

     Networks (GANs) and their variants such as CycleGANs. The successful 

     completion of the project will have a substantial impact on key 

     scientific goals of both the Super-K and Hyper-K experiment, such as 

     the CP violation measurement and other areas of particle physics and 

     astronomy.","Duties:

Name of project: 

     Particle physics with atom traps 

  

Overview: 

     We want to improve our atomic physics probes of the location and spin 

     direction of our trapped radioactive atoms. We've had success in the 

     past measuring accurately the average neutrino direction emitted with 

     respect to the electron direction in beta decay. We can also 

     spin-polarize the nuclei, measuring the average direction of all 

     particles emitted. All our tabletop-sized measurements, just like 

     high-energy physics, have been annoyingly consistent with our present 

     understanding of particle physics, so we interpret our results as 

     constraints on the existence of possible extra new particles. To keep 

     pace with the LHC upgrade, we want to improve our experimental 

     precision. 

     Most of our particle detection development is done by postdocs and 

     grad students, while the undergrads have well-defined projects using 

     optics and atomic physics techniques to improve the atom trapping and 

     spin polarization. These atomic physics projects are on stable 

     potassium atoms readily available to us, allowing us to mimic the 

     behavior of the radioactive isotopes of potassium we trap with 

     dedicated beamtime from TRIUMF's accelerator complex. 

     

     https://trinat.triumf.ca  has some details 

     

     These experiments would be about 2-3 days/week in the atom trap optics 

     lab at TRIUMF, with design and non-immediate analysis taking place on 

     or off-site depending on pandemic status. The on-site research will 

     likely continue to use pandemic protocols following the ALARA 

     (exposure As Low as Reasonably Achievable) principle borrowed from 

     radiation safety.","Duties: 

     Tasks include: 

     improving fast timing and duty cycle of CMOS cameras imaging the 

     atomic cloud; 

     developing better laser cooling of the atoms using a different atomic 

     transition of our potassium atoms; 

     optimizing our upgraded circularly polarized laser system on potassium 

     atom observables.                                                      

  

  

Skills learned during this work experience: 

     Optics characterization and alignment. Control programming. Atomic 

     physics data acquisition and analysis.","Qualifications: 

     Physics or Engineering Physics student preferred. Optics course and/or 

     lab would be an asset. Electronics lab with equivalent of Horowitz and

										Particle Physics with Ultracold Neutrons - Student Project (ONSITE)

Canada's National Laboratory for Particle and Nuclear Physics STUDENT JOB PROGRAM Winter 2022 job posting Job number TR22-1-7 

  

Student job title: 

     ONSITE - Particle physics with ultracold neutrons student project 

  

Name of project: 

     Development work for the neutron EDM experiment 

  

Overview: 

     Knowledge of fundamental properties of the neutron helps us understand 

     many aspects of the universe; it all starts right after the Big Bang: 

     the energy available at the time of the Big Bang created a large 

     number of particle and antiparticle pairs, which in turn, annihilated 

     and transformed back to energy, but in the end matter won over 

     antimatter in the universe, making our existence possible. The main 

     ingredient to that, matter anti-matter asymmetry, requires another 

     fundamental asymmetry, called CP violation. This, in turn might show 

     up in a non-zero electric dipole moment (EDM) of the neutron, making 

     EDM measurements the flagship of fundamental neutron physics. 

     As tools to achieve this, we use ultracold neutrons (UCN), which are 

     neutrons of such remarkably low energies that they are totally 

     reflected from the surfaces of a variety of materials. Hence, they can 

     be confined in material bottles for long periods of time. Typically, 

     UCN have kinetic energies less than 300 neV (and velocities of order 8 

     m/s). Since neutrons are a fundamental constituent of the universe, 

     confined neutrons can be used in experiments to study many interesting 

     questions - like the search for the neutron EDM. 

     

     The UCN facility is currently being commissioned, and the neutron EDM 

     experiment is in the conceptual design phase. Exciting times lie ahead 

     of the UCN project since we perfomed the first production ever of 

     ultracold neutrons in Canada just in 2017! 

     

     Various opportunities exist for an undergrad student to contribute in 

     a significant way to the success and future design of the neutron EDM 

     experiment.","Duties: 

     We are looking for a student to stay with our project for one or two 

     terms. 

     The student will work on developing equipment for the neutron edm 

     experiment. 

     

     Thus the student's duties will be well balanced between hands-on tasks 

     in the laboratory or the experimental area, and office work such as: 

     development of 3D computer models as well as analytical investigations 

     using tools like CAD software, finite element analysis, computing 

     software, or simulation packages (solidworks, opera, ansys, matlab, 

     mathematica, Monte Carlo, GEANT4, and similar). 

     

     The hands-on tasks will be related to the design and/or commissioning 

     of test-setups geared towards the nEDM apparatus. Actively 

     participating in the conceptual design, installation work and 

     measurement campaigns of both, the nEDM and the UCN source will be 

     crucial to the students activities. 

     

     This might require a moderate amount of shift work, if the 

     collaboration performs a beam time with the UCN source, or other 

     resource intensive test and measurement campaigns. 

     

     This entire work will be carried out in an international team 

     environment with physicists and graduate students from the different 

     institutes (KEK, U of Osaka, RCNP, UBC, UNCB, U Manitoba, U Winnipeg, 

     SFU, and TRIUMF) who are part of the Japanese-Canadian UCN-nEDM 

     collaboration. The student will communicate to other collaboration 

     members and give updates about his or her work regularly during oral 

     presentations and written reports.","Skills learned during this work experience: 

     The student will be familiarized with fundamental neutron physics 

     topics, high precision measurement applications, and particle physics 

     techniques. Their analytical skills will be enhanced and experience 

     from course/lab training or previous work terms will be applied to 

     fundamental research. The student will have the possibility to take 

     part in the daily life of an experimental physics collaboration and 

     contribute to the advancement of the project. 

     Additionally, participation in our weekly international status 

     meetings for the UCN source and EDM experiment will introduce the 

     student into the world international collaboration. This will enhance 

     the students communication skills and train clear presentation of 

     technical and scientific concepts to peers. 

     

     We are providing a stimulating environment for students to learn new 

     things while contributing significantly to the overall progress of the 

     UCN/nEDM project. Last but not least, the TRIUMF coop program offers 

     education about other scientific projects related to the Canadian 

     subatomic physics community via student lectures throughout the work 

     term!                                                                 

                                                                 

 Qualifications: 

     Third or Fourth year physics or engineering physics (Eng.Phys.) 

     students with some experimental experience. 

     Affinity for experimental techniques and development is what we are 

     looking for in an ideal candidate. 

     

     We expect the student to work independently on given tasks - after 

     proper introduction to the topic and support by other team members 

     when problems come across. Experience gathered in previous coop terms 

     is appreciated. 

     

     Basic knowledge in programming in any common language/application will 

     be an asset (Python, C/C++, Matlab, Labview, LaTex, etc). 

     

     Experience using CAD software (ideally SolidWorks) is recommended. 

     Some experience using FEA software (e.g. ANSYS, Opera, FEMM) and C++ 

     (or equivalent) and working in a linux-based environment would also be 

     advantageous. 

     Please fill the coop student google questionnaire provided by our 

     program coordinator!

Canada's National Laboratory for Particle and Nuclear Physics STUDENT JOB PROGRAM Spring 2021 job posting Job number TR21-1-16 

  

Student job title: 

     ON-SITE - PMT Test Facility Researcher 

  

Name of project: 

     Photosensor Test Facility for the Hyper-Kamiokande Project 

  

Overview: 

     Neutrino oscillations are the only experimentally verified observation 

     of a process not described by the Standard Model (SM) of particle 

     physics. Since their discovery in 1998 we have learnt a lot about the 

     parameters that govern these oscillations, but there are still many 

     questions remaining. Perhaps the most exciting of these is to 

     determine whether neutrino oscillations violate charge-parity (CP) 

     symmetry, and so could potentially explain why we live in a 

     matter-dominated universe. 

     

     The next generation Hyper-Kamiokande experiment in Japan will be a 

     powerful tool for exploring neutrino oscillations, as well as other 

     phenomena such as proton decay. It will succeed the currently 

     operating Super-Kamiokande and T2K experiments, and come online around 

     2027. The Canadian group is working on a number of interesting R&D 

     efforts aimed towards the Hyper-K project, including a new prototype 

     detector aiming to run in a CERN beam line by 2022. 

     

     The goal of this particular project is to assist in the assembly, 

     commissioning, and operation of a specialized Photosensor Test 

     Facility (PTF) located at TRIUMF. The PTF is designed to allow 

     detailed characterization of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) that are 

     capable of detecting single photons. The key features of the PTF are 

     the ability to fire laser light at a PMT submerged in water from 

     arbitrary angles and directions and measure the reflected laser light 

     at various points. We do this using a pair of optical heads that are 

     translated/rotated using a motor-controlled gantry system. These 

     measurements are crucial for completely understanding the PMT 

     response, in order to simulate the Super-K, Hyper-K and prototype 

     detectors to the precision necessary for a CP violation discovery.","Duties: 

     - Assist with assembly of PTF components, such as gantry system, 

     optical boxes, Helmholtz coils, PMT mounts and cabling 

     

     - Develop detailed PTF measurement procedures, including position, 

     angle, polarization, and magnetic field dependence. 

     

     - Assist with many elements of operation, including motor-controllers, 

     magnetic field measurements, and electrical pulse digitizers. 

     

     - Development and debugging of the modeling of the system with 

     simulation code (COMSOL, GEANT4). 

     

     - Detailed analysis of the PTF data for various types of PMTs (ROOT, 

     Python). 

     

     - Improvement of the PTF setup for reduced uncertainties, increased 

     flexibility and faster turn-around.","Skills learned during this work experience: 

     - Experience in many aspects of a complicated physics problem. This 

     will range from low level work on lab measurement systems and 

     electronics, to the description of the high level capabilities of a 

     next-generation neutrino experiment. 

     

     - Operation of PMTs 

     

     - Operation of a complicated precision calibration system 

     

     - Critical thinking and problem solving 

     

     - Analysis of critical detector data and assessment of statistical and 

     systematic uncertainties 

     

     - Presentation skills from reports in regular meetings at national and 

     international levels 

  

Qualifications: 

     We are looking for a motivated physics student to work on an exciting 

     high-energy physics project. The core skills that we are looking for 

     include: 

     

     - Demonstrated hands-on experience with careful attention to detail 

     

     - Strong competence in the use of computers for serious analysis. 

     

     - Ability to quickly learn several new computer tools and software 

     packages. 

     

     - C++ programming experience. 

     

     - Basic programming skills. 

     

     - Experience in rapid and thorough data analysis. 

     

     - Ability to independently solve problems and investigate 

     alternatives. 

     

     Beneficial skills would include: 

     

     - Experience with using Linux OS would be very beneficial. 

     

     - Experience with standard HEP software packages, in particular GEANT4 

     and ROOT. 

     

     - Understanding of the basics of a particle physics detector, 

     particularly of photo-multiplier tubes.

Student job title: 

     Light sensor developer 

  

Name of project: 

     Back-side illuminated single photon detector development 

  

Overview: 

     Backside illuminated single photon sensor are expected to achieve 

     close to 100% efficiency from vacuum ultra-violet to near infra-red 

     while being directly compatible to 3D integrated electronics. This 

     latter advantage will enable achieving single photon time resolution 

     on the order of 10ps. High efficiency at 128nm, the liquid Argon 

     scintillation wavelength coupled to high timing resolution would 

     enable the design of a new experiment configuration with very high 

     potential for discovering Dark Matter interactions. Used in liquid 

     Xenon, BSI single photon sensors could also be used for dark matter 

     search, probing neutrino properties but also in positron emission 

     tomography (medical imaging).  The goal of the project is to identify 

     a BSI solution that meets Astro-particle physics experiment 

     requirements, and in particular ARGO, a liquid Argon dark matter 

     search experiment.","Duties: 

     The back side illuminated single photon sensors that have been built 

     so far, suffer from their high sensitivity to the production of 

     photons in silicon avalanches. Such avalanches are necessary for the 

     detection of single photons producing single electron-hole pair in 

     silicon. But the production of photons can lead to additional 

     avalanches if they are reabsorbed in the sensor. The sensor then 

     become inaccurate or even unstable. The project duties are to 

     characterize photon production in avalanches in detail using the 

     TRIUMF Microscope for injection and emission of light (MIEL), and to 

     assess the performances of various sensor configuration using 

     simulations tuned to reproduced the MIEL data. The end goal is the 

     identification of solution for mitigating the impact of light 

     production in avalanches in BSI sensor configuration towards the 

     fabrication of a state-of-the-art sensor.

Name of project: 

     2D translation stage for beam characterization at the TRIUMF 

     Irradiation Facilities PIF & NIF 

  

Overview: 

     Electronic components exposed to a radiation environment can 

     experience loss of function due both to the accumulation of radiation 

     damage over time or because of a single high-energy interaction with a 

     subatomic particle, called a single-event effect.  In applications 

     with more intense radiation environments, such as space or air flight, 

     or in low-error-tolerance application such as the automotive industry, 

     testing of the radiation sensitivity of electronic components is a 

     standard part of the qualification process for new components. 

     TRIUMF's PIF & NIF facility provide low-intensity, energetic proton 

     and neutron beams to simulate radiation exposures either in space or 

     terrestrial environments. Even at low intensity, several minutes of 

     exposure in these beams can simulate years of operation in space, air, 

     or ground, effectively allowing users to perform accelerated testing 

     of electronics components in the radiation conditions present in those 

     environments.  Precise characterization of the beam profile is crucial 

     for the proton and neutron beam lines of the PIF & NIF facility, as 

     high beam uniformity is needed for most of the radiation tests done at 

     PIF & NIF.  Over the past year, a 2D translation stage with optical 

     fibre holder was designed and assembled for use in the beam lines 

     operated by PIF & NIF.  This stage will allow precise characterization 

     of the 2D cross section of the beams at the operating position in both 

     neutrons and proton beams. The main goal of the project is to take the 

     newly assembled 2D stage, complete its commissioning and develop the 

     software tools needed to be able to use it routinely at PIF & NIF.","Duties: 

     With the mechanical assembly now done, the student would take over 

     responsibility for the commissioning of the 2D stage for beam 

     characterization with optical fibres, including improvements to 

     resolve issues brought up during the early commissioning such as 

     cross-direction position jitter and motor-induced noise. They will be 

     responsible for the development of the software interface to run the 

     2D stage with the optical fibre detector, including the graphical user 

     interface.  

     

     Furthermore, the stage is envisioned to also be used with another type 

     of beam mapping sensor, based on SRAM memory.  The student will be 

     responsible to design, coordinate the manufacturing of, and assemble a 

     dedicated mechanical holder for the SRAM detector to be used with the 

     2D stage.  They will also write the software package enabling 

     synchronized use of the SRAM detector and the 2D stage, and 

     accompanying graphical user interface.  The work will be documented 

     for use by TRIUMF teams and is expected to contribute to one or more 

     scientific publications.                                              

  

Skills learned during this work experience: 

     Python programming (possibly also C++ if desired), Arduino 

     programming, knowledge of radiation sensors, mechanical and software 

     design and implementation, using and controlling stepping motors, 

     working in a multidisciplinary R&D team, writing scientific reports, 

     articles and documentation.","Qualifications: 

     The candidate should be a student in a relevant engineering specialty 

     (physics, electrical, electronic, software), comp sci  or  physics 

     with interest in multidisciplinary projects.  Knowledge of Python 

     programming is necessary.  Experience with Arduino programming, 

     SolidWorks and 3D printing are assets.  The student should be in 3rd 

     or 4th year and have work experience overlapping some of the tools and 

     tasks in the project description.  They should be enthusiastic about 

     picking up new skills and learning new tools and will be expected to 

     seek out the resources needed to self-teach these skills during the 

     project term.

     dynamics with the goal of optimizing the beam luminosity into a small 

     target.","Duties: 

     -Learn to understand and operate the G4beamline simulation 

     environment. 

     -Set up a ML NN environment (on a 64 thread/GPU equipped computer) 

     using the G4beamline simulation as the data/reward source vs the 

     beamline settings inputs for a relatively simple surface muon 

     beamline. 

     -Model performance evaluation 

     -If time permits, extend the work to a decay muon beamline. 

     -The student will draw on the experience of a similar project 

     currently underway at TRIUMF for low energy charged nuclei. 

     -Write a report.

							",4 month work term,"The DATA team is a research lab located within the University Health Network, the largest health research organization in North America. The DATA team aims to enable better and faster medicine through use of smarter computer tools. We create cutting-edge web and mobile applications, programs and databases for large-scale data collection and analytics.  


Headquartered within the DATA team, CanDIG (Canada's Distributed Infrastructure for Genomics) is a team building a national federated platform for connecting private health research data. We have team members across Canada building the platform and working with physicians and data custodians assembling the health data it supports. 


UHN CanDIG co-op trainees work on real code that ships and becomes part of or supports the national platform and data analysis efforts.  Trainees will be active members of the team, participating in standups, having weekly one-on-ones with their mentor, will have an onboarding buddy and one or more well-defined projects.  It's not unusual for co-op students to attend local or virtual conferences (we are members of the GA4GH international standards organization, and part of the CINECA international health data federation project) and co-op students occasionally get their names on research papers.  Previous co-op students have worked on back-end data services in Python or go, front-end services in React, data analysis, data warehouse/ETL pipelines, devops work in deployment or automation, and authentication and authorization services. Co-op students are encouraged to learn new technologies, and work independently but with the support of an entire team. 


A quote from our most recent co-op: ""From the various projects that I worked on I was able to learn about building ETL and CI/CD pipelines, working with various APIs, as well as backend development with Linux. The entire team was extremely welcoming and helpful, and offered me great support throughout the term.""","We are seeking a highly motivated trainee to help us expand the CanDIG platform and assemble the health research data we are connecting with the platform. 


The successful candidate will work closely with scientists, researchers and software developers to develop and customize software, and be an active part of our development or deployment teams. 


Because the CanDIG project is broad, there are a number of areas that a trainee joining us could work in. They could involve:
 

Development of backend services, supporting ReST and/or GraphQL APIs, in Python or Go
Data modelling or database work, typically with relational databases (although there's some MongoDB and ElasticSearch)
Work on our authentication and authorization and security infrastructure, particularly around monitoring and analysis of logs
Development of rich frontend visualization for complex data
Work on our deployment infrastructure - docker, docker swarm, ansible, terraform, and automation thereof

We don't expect deep knowledge in those areas for incoming trainees; only some related experience. Most importantly,  a willingness to learn independently with support. 


We will continue to be hiring remotely within Canada during the pandemic. To optimize remote learning, we have greatly improved our co-op onboarding process.","Co-ops who have been most successful with us have been those who have some existing software development or deployment skills in a related area, are excited about quickly adapting to new skills, and are willing to contact team members with questions once they've tried answering the question themselves. We value having a very diverse team in a number of different respects, and are looking for co-ops who value all dimensions of that diversity. 


We don't require deep expertise in particular technical skills, but in our experience we'll have a better opportunity matching you with projects you'll be able to succeed at during a co-op term if you have experience with a couple of the following:
 

Implementing client or server for an API, either REST or GraphQL
Data modelling or improving performance of database queries (any database)
Transforming or analyzing tabular data
Automation and orchestration of workflows
Can write simple bash (or other linux shell) scripts for automation of collections of tasks
Currently fluent enough with at least one of Python, JS, or Go to be able to propose a simple change for a simple functionality improvement to some code, and to offer a respectful code review of such a change

Any of the following would be bonuses but are not necessary:

 

Using OAuth2/OIDC authentication, or any kind of security work
Experience with docker or docker-compose
Previous work with bioinformatics tools or health research data
More advanced bash, python, JS, Go, or bash/linux skills
More advanced database experience

However, currently, these tools are only available in a variety of software packages and require frequent file type conversion. 

  

The aim of this project is to add modules to software platform previously developed in an open-source image processing (3D Slicer) that includes tools for image registration, segmentation and feature extraction/quantification such as erosions in multi-modal imaging in rheumatoid arthritis applications. Development will be done using 3D Slicer and Python (ITK, VTK) toolkits in the underlying framework. 

  

The student will work in a research lab environment (https://cumming.ucalgary.ca/labs/manske/) and have the opportunity to interact with graduate students and post-doctoral fellows, and take part in trainee activities within the McCaig Institute for Bone and Joint Health (including weekly seminar series, career development opportunities). The student may have the opportunity to contribute to scientific publications (e.g., conference abstracts, manuscripts). In addition, the quantitative tools developed here will be shared with an international collaboration (SPECTRA - Study group for xtReme-Computed Tomography in RA; https://www.spectra-collab.org/home).","Work alongside a PhD student (Biomedical Engineering; BSc Electrical Engineering) to carry-out the day to day tasks, supervised by the Principal Investigator (Image Science, Department of Radiology) and Co-Investigator (Software Engineering, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering).

OpenSim (https://opensim.stanford.edu/) is an open-source software platform for modelling musculoskeletal systems and generating simulations of human and animal movement. The first version of OpenSim was developed at Stanford University; it is now an open-source project that is used by thousands of researchers, clinicians, and roboticists worldwide. Your contributions to this project will benefit nearly every user of the software. This work is a high priority for the OpenSim team and it will have a large positive impact on the field. 


The objective of this project is to automate model calibration, the procedure by which a musculoskeletal model is adjusted to match the dimensions of a human subject---a notoriously difficult process for new OpenSim users. The ideal candidate will have expertise in designing and developing well-organized, well-documented C++ code; familiarity with biomechanics and optimization would be assets but are not essential. You will work closely with Prof. Uchida at uOttawa (https://www.thomasuchida.com/) and coordinate with others on the OpenSim Development Team at Stanford University and Delft University of Technology. You will design, develop, test, and document a new optimization strategy to produce better OpenSim models in less time than the current outdated tools, making OpenSim's capabilities available to a broader community of users. Prototype code has been developed and will be provided as a starting point. 


This project is funded by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative's Essential Open Source Software for Science Program (https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/automated-optimal-model-calibration-for-the-opensim-biomechanics-simulator/). You will have the opportunity to engage with the other teams funded by this program, as well as the researchers working on Prof. Uchida's team. Some additional information about the project can be found here: https://engineering.uottawa.ca/professor-uchida-and-czi-funding-open-source-software-moving-toward-success.","You will first learn about the objectives of the project, the OpenSim API (https://simtk.org/api_docs/opensim/api_docs/), and the prototype code that has been developed. You will then design and implement a model calibration tool in C++ that adheres to the OpenSim coding standards, build test cases to verify the implementation, write doxygen documentation for programmers and scripting users, and integrate the implementation into the OpenSim codebase on GitHub (https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-core). You will work with the developers at Stanford to design the interface and plan a series of design reviews accompanied by GitHub Pull Requests to ensure a smooth integration process. 


You will lead and manage the project, meeting with Prof. Uchida at least once per week. You will also attend and provide updates at Prof. Uchida's Research Team meetings (once per month) and OpenSim Developer Team meetings hosted by the team at Stanford (approx. every 2 months).","Required:

							",4 month work term,"Video chat with end-to-end encryption


Cynorix (www.cynorix.com) is a startup, founded by University of Waterloo faculty members, focusing on various security products. Cynorix distinction is in its innovative solutions founded on Information Theoretical principles, brought to life through the power of software. This position is to work on secure video chat product of Cynorix. 
 

Summary in non-technical terms: There are a large number of video chat applications in the market, however, none of the existing video chat applications support true end-to-end encryption. This means, the video/audio is encrypted within the sender's computer and decrypted only at its final destination. This is quite challenging when the number of participants is 100 or more. In addition to end-to-end encryption, Cynorix video chat application has several other distinct features, such as an authentication system that makes the most common form of attack on such systems, namely the man-in-the-middle attack, impossible. We also rely on machine learning to detect from the face gestures when a person is speaking and automatically mute/unmute the micro-phone (mute if the participant is just listening to others, and unmute if the participant is actively speaking). This features improves the privacy, and also reduces the network load.","Work in more technical terms: The video chat itself is implemented starting from an open source sfotware. Main features of the chat itself are completed, but we need to speed-up the key distribution algorithm, enhance the management platform in forming and managing chat rooms, and in interfacing the chat events with email and calendar entries. The machine learning algorithm for face gesture detection needs to be enhanced, to improve accuracy, reduce the size as well as the complexity. The authentication is through Cynorix authentication platform, in which the loop is closed by scanning a QR code. We want to provide the option of using near field or Bluetooth connectivity for closing the loop. This requires developing an application (that should be installed) for Windows/MAC, as compared to the current setup in which the entire system is browser-based.

Cynorix (www.cynorix.com) is a startup, founded by University of Waterloo faculty members, focusing on various security products. Cynorix distinction is in its innovative solutions founded on Information Theoretical principles, brought to life through the power of software. This position is to work on secure file sharing product of Cynorix. 


Summary in non-technical terms: These days we all use cloud for delivering of documents. Many such documents contain sensitive information and should be delivered from a sender to a receiver in an encrypted form. This is called end-to-end encryption, i.e., file is encrypted locally within the sender's computer and decrypted locally within the receiver's computer. It is also desirable that the provider of this file sharing service does not have access to encryption key or password used to encrypt the file and thereby cannot decrypt the file even if they want to. The main challenge in realizing this setup is as follows: How can the receiver decrypt a file that is encrypted using the sender's password, where sender password is not stored anywhere, and is never shared. We have been able to solve this problem. This means, in our setup, a file that is encrypted using person A's password, upon being shared with person B in encrypted form, can be decrypted using person B's password; and this happens without storing/sharing the passwords (nor encryption keys) and without passwords (nor encryption keys) ever leaving their owner's local computers.  Each user types his/her password when prompted, the local program uses the typed password to generate the encryption key, uses the key to encrypt or to decrypt the file, and then the password and the key are erased from the local computer. Using one password to encrypt a file and another password on a different computer to decrypt the same file may sound impossible, so please join us to see how Information Theory empowers such an apparently impossible task.","Technical work: The above file sharing is implemented on Google cloud using Google firebase and codes are in Java script. The authentication is through Google platform, but Cynorix has a more advanced authentication platform that we would like to integrate with the secure file sharing. Cynorix authentication setup is functional on its own, but the associated registration system and two factor authentication need to be modified to function in harmony with Google authentication.   


There are several aspects and accordingly job resposibilities. The candidate, depending on qualifcation and personal interest, can get involved in one or more of the following general tasks:

Job Summary

We are seeking a student who is eager to apply their expertise in math, programming, advanced analytics techniques, and data science to improve healthcare. The student will focus on development of novel analytical approaches to maximize utility of outcomes for key health indicators (e.g. activity, sleep, social engagement) derived from wearable sensor data.  


The NiMBaL and NRE research teams focus on:

-Understanding how the brain and other parts of the central nervous system control human movement 

-Applying concepts of remote patient monitoring and big data techniques to self- and clinical management of health and disease 

-Advancing assistive technology for independent mobility and rehabilitation by applying principles of biomedical signal processing, data science, and robotics. 

-Translating this knowledge for early detection and prevention of health decline, monitoring disease progression and treatment effectiveness, and helping individuals to maximize their recovery following a neurological injury, such as a stroke. 


We interpret this information to help find ways to minimize age- and disease-related effects on health and movement control. We conduct research in university-based and hospital-based labs and in the community using portable, cost-effective measurement tools. 


Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative (ONDRI)

The NiMBaL Lab conducts several research projects in collaboration with ONDRI (http://ondri.ca). ONDRI's objective is to improve the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and dementias. ONDRI's first large-scale study was a longitudinal cohort study capturing data from hundreds of patients across multiple assessment domains including: gait and balance, neuroimaging, neuropsychology, clinical, eye-tracking, genetics, and spectral domain optical coherence tomography. 

  

Most recently, ONDRI has launched a province-wide Master Observational Trial (HANDDS-ONT); an innovative, fully remote study including continuous monitoring of health-related behaviours (e.g. posture, activity, sleep, mobility, social engagement, and cognition). The NiMBaL lab co-leads the collection and analysis of ONDRI gait and balance data as well as data captured from wearable technologies worn at home and in the community. A unique challenge of the remote monitoring studies is the need to manage large volumes of data, captured from multiple sensors, measuring many behaviors over several days.  


Since 2019, the NRE Lab has partnered with NiMBal to combine expertise in biophysical signal processing and applied research methods for application to aging and neurodegenerative disease (both within and beyond the ONDRI program of research). This partnership, which brings together engineers and computer scientists with applied health scientists and clinicians, affords a unique opportunity to advance tools and methods for health assessment outside of a clinic setting in real-world conditions.","Responsibilities

-Apply signal processing skills to biophysical signals to extract meaningful outcome measures 

-Work with the NiMBaL and NRE teams to determine programming needs and objectives 

-Critically review literature for existing algorithms/approaches and evaluate suitability for implementation with respect to team's research needs/objectives.

The students will become full-time members of the quantum simulation group and directly contribute to meeting its near-term goals of delivering quantum simulators to early adopters. In the process, the student will acquire valuable knowledge and skills in building and operating integrated software/hardware modules powering a complex scientific apparatus. This experience will prepare the student for making a meaningful contribution in quantum information science in academia and the industry.","The student will be assigned a project directly contributing to improving the performance of our quantum simulator with specific and realistic deliverables. Typical projects involve developing a software module to simulate and control one or more hardware devices to accomplish a specific task, e.g., 
 

Creating large homogeneous arrays of optical tweezers using acousto-optic deflectors and/or spatial light modulators;
Developing and benchmarking novel algorithms for sorting neutral atoms in arrays of optical traps;
Designing, building, and characterizing a low-latency control system to acquire and process images from a high-resolution camera using NVIDIA's GPUDirect protocol;
Designing, manufacturing, and characterizing a high-resolution microscope objective.

We currently are looking into expanding our research activities into the following areas

 

Developing a browser-based front-end user interface for early adopters to submit jobs onto our quantum simulator. This front-end interface will be used to demonstrate our experimental capability to investors and might establish the basis of a cloud-based quantum computing service.
Developing and implementing reconfiguration algorithms based on graph theory using graphical processing units (with collaborators from the Faculty of Mathematics).","We spend a significant amount of our effort mentoring students to accelerate their personal and professional development, so we are looking into hiring ambitious and hard-working top-of-the-class students that aim at achieving nothing less than outstanding work. 
The most successful students will be independent, inquisitive, proactive, and hardworking, continuously seeking opportunities to improve themselves and achieve excellence.

 

 

In terms of skills, we are seeking quick learners with strong analytical and critical thinking skills and a strong academic background in (applied) mathematics, physics engineering, hardware/software system design, and programming (Python, C++, CUDA).

Department: Enrolment and Upper-Year Transitions, St. Jerome's University 

Reports to: Manager, Outreach and Recruitment 

Employment: January 2022 - April 2022 

  

What you'll do:

As the Outreach and Recruitment Associate, you're part of a small but energetic team who works with prospective students to determine if St. Jerome's University is where they want to live, study, and grow. You'll be responsible for planning and implementing outreach and recruitment activities such as Fall (Virtual) Open House, (virtual) campus tours, (online) school visits, TikTok videos, and/or Instagram Stories. You'll also be working with student leaders and staff to oversee the Ambassador Program, and you'll be interacting with future students to answer their questions live, on the phone, through e-mail, at the front desk (if on campus at all), and over various interactive web platforms (such as blogs, the SJU website, social media, etc.). It's a fast-paced, people-first environment with multiple projects on the go at any given time through which you will actively contribute to bringing in the next cohort of St. Jerome's University students at the University of Waterloo. Your suggestions, ideas, and innovations are encouraged and empowered as a member of this team.","A typical day may look like:

- Take, edit, and create photos, videos, and other visual content that can be added to various web platforms (such as what activities students will attend in their best Hallowe'en costumes!). 

- Call back a parent of a prospective student who has questions about co-registration between SJU and Waterloo. 

- Eat your lunch while playing our classic ""SJU Stay at Home Trivia"" with staff, faculty, and students. 

- Attend a Recruitment Roundtable meeting and share your ideas in preparation for Fall (Virutal) Open House. 

- Analyze statistics you gathered in a survey of why current students chose to study at SJU and/or live at SJU. 

- Reach out to a Professor in the English Department at SJU to do a quick interview about the exciting online lessons and course they are planning for the Winter (and so you can share it on social media!) 

- Partner with the Student Affairs team to create off-campus (online) social events for continuing students  

- Join staff and faculty as they come together (on Zoom) for a weekly coffee time on Friday mornings. A great opportunity to get to know the people that you work alongside!","This position might be right for you if:

- Your calendar is detailed and colour-coordinated, and you've already mapped out what your next two weeks look like. 

- You love having friends over and making sure they have all the food and comfort they need to enjoy themselves. 

- You're an enthusiastic member of a team, able to take charge and stand in the spotlight, but are also just as happy to ensure everything is running smoothly behind the scenes. 

- You thrive by helping people and by going that extra mile to make sure their interaction with you is a memorable one. 

- You love social media and might spend more time that you'd like to admit out loud posting, retweeting, and scrolling through endless TikTok videos. 

- You're a self-motivated self-starter who takes initiative to dive into new projects without being asked. 

- You are passionate about digital design and digital communication and like creating and editing videos, graphics, and creative content. 

- You think creatively and outside the box, but you also know how to pay attention to details and stay focused on your priorities. 

  

You might also stand out if you have:

- experience in recruitment, marketing, sales, and/or public speaking 

- knowledge of St. Jerome's University and the University of Waterloo 

- knowledge of the Kitchener-Waterloo region and culture 

- creative skills in fine arts, digital media, photography/video making, and/or writing 

- natural and genuine customer service skills 

- a strong desire to learn and grow, to ask questions, and to bring your best each day. 

  

Why SJU?

Every day we put ourselves in the shoes of our future students to go where they are, understand their needs and wants, and make standard what our competitors consider above and beyond. We challenge ourselves to be 1% better tomorrow than we are today, and we rely on each other to guide and to give that extra push when needed. At the end of the day, we want to raise the profile of the university, and we want to create memorable moments and lasting relationships with our current and future students.   

  

Interested?

We're excited to add your energy and ideas to our team. If you feel you might have only some of the qualifications we're looking for, but you're willing to work hard and learn the rest, we'd still love to see your application!","Targeted Clusters

							",4 month work term,"Untether AI is a rapidly growing Toronto startup building a next generation hardware AI accelerators for neural net inference. We're designing integrated circuits that will run neural nets orders of magnitude faster and lower power. This class of chips will be the standard platform for running image recognition, speech synthesis, text to speech and many other applications in data centers, mobile phones and self driving cars within the next 5 years. 


As we work on the design of our next chip, we are building software in several areas:
 

  - Hardware emulation: Functional emulation of the entire chip, allowing us to run jobs before we have actual silicon. 

- Compiler infrastructure: Compiler, place-and-route, tooling and standard libraries required run neural net models on our custom hardware. 

- Runtime infrastructure: Kernel drivers and server run-time environment for integrating our chip into data centers or other client applications. 


We are looking for self motivated and innately curious candidates. You can expect to be contributing to a small agile team working in one of the core areas, and be provided with close mentoring and guidance from senior software engineers. In addition, because we're building new systems from the ground up, you get to work on new unsolved problems, building systems with few external dependencies and no legacy codebase.

Reproduce or adapt recent published neural net research on quantization and sparsity (using pytorch, tensorflow, numpy, etc)
Work on PCIe linux kernel drivers
Help with chip bring-up, testing and ensuring that our board, chip and associated software all work together","Required Skills

We don't have strict skill requirements, but of course prior experience in the tools and skills we use is a plus:
 

Tools and programming languages we use: python, numpy, keras, tensorflow, C, C++, cocotb, verilog git
Topics we are interested in include: neural net training and inference, compiler design, digital logic design and analysis, graphs and high dimensional spaces
