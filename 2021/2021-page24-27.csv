							",4 month work term,"Machine learning (ML) is at the forefront of the rising popularity of data-driven software applications. The resulting rapid proliferation of ML technology, explosive data growth, and shortage of data science expertise have caused the industry to face increasingly challenging demands to keep up with fast-paced develop-and-deploy model lifecycles. Recent academic and industrial research efforts have started to address this problem through automated machine learning (AutoML) pipelines and have focused on model performance as the first-order design objective. Oracle AutoML [1] is a novel iteration-free AutoML pipeline designed to not only provide accurate models, but also in a shorter runtime. These objectives are achieved by eliminating the need to continuously iterate over various pipeline configurations. Our approach to AutoML has been shown to achieve better scores at a fraction of the time compared to state-of-the-art, making it a prime candidate for addressing industry challenges.

Moreover, as there is an ever-increasing number of deployed models, automated explainability techniques are required to provide insight into their complex behavior and the data they work with. They help humans understand the reasons behind model predictions as well as aid in debugging, improve performance, identify bias and unfairness in the models, and potentially support compliance with new regulations such as ""right to explanation"". Our group is focused on building a novel framework that gives novice and advanced data scientists the power of AutoML and explainability in a single, easy-to-use, python package.","Featured job topics: AutoML and/or explainability for classification, regression, anomaly detection, and forecasting tasks; Explore support for federated learning; Explore techniques to reduce model bias while tuning; Extend dataset support for unstructured (e.g., NLP) and semi-structured (e.g., video/audio/graph) data; Generic model support including GNNs, DNNs and/or RNNs.","Enrolled in MS/PhD in Computer Science/Engineering, or related field

The group also works to integrate the development tools and processes to improve the development experience. The mission of DevOps at Eloqua is to make the development process more repeatable, consistent and transparent. 


The devops co-op is a key member of the co-op team with a great aptitude to learn and a can-do attitude.  The position requires the student to understand the challenges of development, qa and operational side of product development in order to help with the end to end process of getting a product to customer's hands. This is not a one-dimensional role where the right candidate will be challenged on multiple fronts, learning complex database, software, operational and scripting solutions from day one and applying the learnings on a day-to-day basis.","This person is expected to be innovative and detail oriented with excellent communication skills. The position includes administration and integration of devops tools such as JIRA, Teamcity, Git, Chef as well as Testing frameworks. In addition there is a great opportunity to learn more about Microsoft Technology Stack and Oracle Technology Stack in Software Development. The position requires the Integration Engineer to understand the unique challenges of Development, QA, and Production Operations and develop innovative solutions that enable these groups to work smarter, faster and better. The successful candidate will possess a passion for new technology and display a deep understanding of best practices.","Skillsets needed 

  

While we know that not everyone can be a master at everything, we are looking for people with interest and basic understanding of the following 

  

Git - You are more than just a Git user. Would you know how to branch, merge, squash, stash, and patch? 

  

Linux - Need system level knowledge of Linux. Starting from understanding of Kernel architecture, process management and configuring a linux system? 

  

Windows - Everyone has done windows sometime or other. You will be doing more. Need to know Windows Services layer, APIs and probably done some sort of batch scripting on windows 

  

Chef/Puppet - Have you done Chef or Puppet? By that what we mean is you have written scripts using these tools, not just used them. If not, how about CFEngine, Saltstack, or Ansible? 

  

System Administration - Would you know how to add new windows users? Start/Stop services , setup new windows and linux machines? 

  

Apache Webservers - Have you setup an Apache Webserver? If not, how about Nginx? Understanding of webservers and how it works would be an essential skill 

  

Ruby/Python - You should have programmed significantly on Ruby or Python. What we are talking about are much more than writing some simple scripts or knowing the syntax. Share with us what you have done and show us how you can program in them 

  

CI Systems - We are big on Teamcity. If you are not, don't worry, how about Jenkins/Buildbot/Electric Commander/Hudson/Circle or any other popular ones? Again, we are looking for someone who has modeled workflows in a CI system and has in depth administration knowledge or at least understanding of the concepts. All developers these days use CI systems, but our group supports these for 100s of developers 

  

Databases / SQL - Being at Oracle developing enterprise systems, we need you to have a pretty good understanding of databases. We prefer Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle Database. If your understanding of how these databases work is minimal, we would at least want you to be a SQL expert. We expect you to know JOIN/UNION/SCHEMA/STREAM/… 

  

Shell/Perl/Regex - Knowing Shell scripting or Perl would show us that you have solid system administration automation experience. 

  

Java/C++/C# -- Have you done any application development. While this is not a must-have, we would know you can hold your own if you have done this 

  

Networking - We deal with very many networking challenges in our day-to-day work. While we do not expect you to be a network administrator , understanding of the basic concepts of networking is a must have. 

  

Dockers and Containers - Being able to build and deploy images is a critical part of our operations. We expect all our stack to be containerized in the next several months. Have you heard about this technology and does it interest you 

Agile/Scrums/Kanban/JIRA - Devops team does agile. We have 2 week sprints and practice our development methodologies religiously. We have roadmaps, goals and challenging deliverables while managing the day-to-day support needs 

  

Communication skills - Perhaps this is one of the most important skills that is often overlooked. Our team currently is spread across potentially 6 geographical locations and effective oral and written communication is what's really going to make it successful. Devops @ Oracle requires people skills in supporting several people around the world and gone are the days when you are a reclusive programmer.","Targeted Clusters

I'm looking for someone that can help speed up the development process. I have an infinite list of things to build for this game, and I can only put so many hours in of my own time. The game is written in C# using the Unity engine, targeting the PC platform, and it's been under full-time development since August 2019.

You'll be working closely with me and the artist to build out a bunch of new features, help fix bugs and even contribute to game design ideas and planning. An interest in playing games in this survival genre would be ideal.

You can try out the current alpha version of the game by hitting the playtest ""Request Access"" button on the Steam page: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1564600","- Translate requirements into complicated but clean and efficient code 

- Produce prototypes of gameplay ideas and features

Coursework in statistics. Applied statistics and probability are the focus of the position: if you can converse about regression models, and clustering approaches, you'll be fine.  
Prior exposure to a statistical or scientific programming environment is helpful. If you don't have it, you'll become familiar while you're here.  We have a bias for open source tech, and work with the Python scientific stack, R, and various data pipeline tools.  
Excellent oral and written communication skills will help. You'll work with both experts in the field and business staff, so you'll find it important to be able to communicate appropriately with both as needed.","Targeted Clusters

This is an opportunity for students to help design and make an immense impact at a fast-growing company. You should value and practice transparency, have the humility to accept your weaknesses, and continuously strive to improve personally and professionally. 


About PerkUp


PerkUp drives employee engagement by allowing companies to issue pre-loaded credit cards to their employees to spend freely on perks they actually want, such as child care, wellness, fitness, home office, and education. These pre-loaded credit cards are marketed as ""perk cards"" and only work with merchants that are supported by PerkUp and approved by the employer.  


In today's work environment, companies must innovate beyond free lunches in order to effectively acquire top talent, improve engagement, and retain high performers. Outside of traditional benefits, it's difficult for HR and finance teams to deploy perk programs that are flexible, inclusive, tax-efficient, and easy to manage.

Our online analytics platform provides businesses with indispensable strategic consumer data, as well as spatial and analytical intelligence for sustainable growth. Our clients range from individual franchisees, to Fortune 500 retailers, to real estate companies and international consulting firms. Ideally, the co-op will have web development experience and work on full-stack web development. If the co-op is less comfortable with development, the co-op student will likely do some QA. 

 
 

  We strongly encourage collaboration and sharing, informally and formally. 



Our quick twice-a-day Stand Up meetings are an opportunity to briefly share what we are working on, ask questions, discuss some challenges.
Our weekly Code Review sessions are meant to encourage team members to show their work to the team, ask questions about the code and best practices, and let the team offer suggestions.
During our biweekly Code Base Architecture sessions, a full-time team member walks our software team through a piece of our code base and we discuss how that fits into the overall platform, as well as best practices to use.
During our weekly Demo/Presentation sessions, someone on our client team walks the whole team through a presentation, demo, or use case that we worked on recently, so that our whole team can see the business applications of our company, as well as the business applications of individual components our team members work on.

Our Tech Stack

We use JavaScript in a Symfony framework. We want to use some React. We are also in the middle of implementing an API. Bring your toolkit of skills and help us make choices about our environment going forward.","Co-ops have the opportunity to make a large impact.

Possible Responsibilities:

Work on various web development projects with Javascript and PHP, hopefully with some React
Learn from and share knowledge in weekly code reviews, biweekly codebase architecture meetings, weekly demos
Software QA
Refactor code
Write monthly release notes for our webapp to communicate new features, capabilities, and offerings
Ad hoc support as needed","Who are you?

You have programming experience
Ideally you are comfortable programming in PHP and Javascript.
You are high-energy, eager to learn, excited by new challenges, and a self-starter. Ambiguity doesn't scare you, and you're not afraid to ask questions when you need help.
You will also have the opportunity to wear many hats and get involved in many aspects of a business.","Targeted Clusters

What is the opportunity?

The primary objective is to work closely with the Director of HR Metrics to build engagement and alignment across all platforms regarding metrics used across all the various reports, dashboards and analysis provided to key stakeholders.  

  

It will involve liaising with key partners in gathering information and requirements on what is currently being used, seeking to understand the key purpose of the artefact, understanding the underlying assumptions on what the metric is that they are currently using, and identifying and documenting opportunities for alignment and highlighting gaps.  It may also involve referencing the various sources of data that are used in generating the artefact and identifying where mapping documents may be required in order to ensure a common understanding and language around the attributes and measures used to generate truly enterprise-wide metrics.  

  

Success in this role will ensure we continue to break down silos and operate as OneRBC, enabling opportunities to not only streamline resources, reduce duplicity but also allow for more value-add work.","What will you do?

Develop metrics definitions and visualization strategies that can be adopted on an enterprise wide basis through collaborative design thinking. The Student will ensure each platform is included in each and every metric being assessed: Capital Markets, Investor & Treasury Services, Insurance, Personal & Commercial Banking, Technology & Operations, Wealth Management, Ventures and Corporate Development, HR, Administration, Finance, Group Risk Management, Internal Audit, the Office of the CEO.  Where a platform is de-scoped for a metric, the rationale for this decision will be clearly documented by the Student.
Define and document a catalog of metrics, ensuring that the key metrics needed for the Workday launch in Spring 2022 are prioritized - the number of metrics scoped for inclusion and assessment over the duration of the rotation is still to be determined.  This will require an aggressive, but carefully metered approach to ensuring timelines for work sprints of Workday launch are not impeded by, but rather complimented with, the Metrics work.
Ensure that documentation of the process used in gathering requirements, underlying assumptions about metrics definitions, identification of alignment opportunities and valid exceptions is clear enough to serve as a key foundation for future work that will continue on with the metrics and serve to be part of the institutional memory that may be used for other purposes (including the facilitation of change management efforts, and possible effort-to-outcome measurement of the value-add activity).","What do you need to succeed?

We're an embedded startup inside RFA, a Canadian financial services company that includes RFA Bank of Canada, a Schedule I Canadian bank (https://www.rfa.ca). 


About the Opportunity

This is a chance to work in Fintech with a small, passionate group of developers and business people where you can contribute to products people will immediately use. If you like solving for real problems with immediate impact--and seeing a user light up when they use software you helped build--this is a great opportunity for you. 


Our stack is modern in implementation (microservices architecture, distributed systems, and event-based architecture; React micro-frontend) with a lot of engineering leeway for innovation, and we're pretty obsessed with user experience. You should be, too.  


At RFA you will work with talented devs on engineering problems (though there's a lot of that), but also experience the whole development cycle. We start with user interviews and need-finding (design thinking, event storming), explore innovative ideas, ask questions, and move as a team to rapidly build and iterate with consistent feedback. 


Your experience working at RFA will include:

A super supportive dev culture: As long as you're willing to work hard and learn, you will have the tools, feedback, and resources you need to succeed.
A humble, non-hierarchical environment: Our culture is one of humility and hard work: we care more about building great things than anybody's ego. Best idea always wins--including yours!
