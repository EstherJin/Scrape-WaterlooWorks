Where will you be working?

  

IBI Group's traffic operations and road user safety group, at the Toronto office, is looking for a four month Co-op student to join our team. We are currently in a work from home model during COVID-19, but when we do return to the office we're located at 55 St Clair Ave West, Toronto, Ontario. The student will need to be local to the Toronto office and able to work remotely until we return to the office. 


  

Do you want to save lives, and generally make the world a better place? If so, IBI Group's Traffic Operations and Safety Group wants you! Don't let the name fool you, it's not just about cars. The traffic operations and road user safety practice at IBI Group works with transportation agencies across North America, and around the world, to provide safe and efficient transportation solutions including proposing new Intelligent Transportation Systems deployments/plans and transit priority measures. We rely heavily on the use of simulation and prediction models to assess the delay and collision impacts of proposed changes to traffic controls and other roadway features to improve operations for all modes. The work we do is highly analytical and data driven, and we take on a lot of challenges that have never been attempted before. At present, we have a portfolio of active projects which involve traffic operations and safety analysis and modelling, design and implementation of traffic control and transit priority systems, rapid transit multi-modal network integration, and parking supply and demand management. We also work on a variety of major rapid transit infrastructure projects in the Greater Toronto Area including York Region VIVA, the Yonge North and Scarborough Subway Extensions, Eglinton Crosstown LRT, and Hurontario LRT. We're looking for keen, motivated individuals, who are interested in exploring a career in the operations side of transportation. 

  

Most of the analysts and engineers that make up the traffic operations and road user safety group are former co-op students, and we do our best to provide all of our students with meaningful work and opportunities to learn through real world problem solving. We want your time at IBI to be a mutually beneficial experience.","Responsibilities: 

• Conduct traffic operations analysis and modelling;

Over 350 million consumers are reached monthly across Insticator's vast network of elite publishing partners that include Warner Bros., Ancestry.com, Tribune Media, Rodale, Evolve Media, Crave Media, The Atlantic and more. Insticator empowers more than 6,000 content creators monthly with its revenue and engagement increasing products, while providing monetizing content opportunities for publishers and brands. 


The Position 


Insticator is looking for a front-end engineer to join our growing team of talented developers. We want someone who's passionate about creating engaging web experiences that users love interacting with and engineers love maintaining. 


You should love clean, intuitive interfaces and be somewhere on the scale of professionally to inappropriately excited about reusable, modular, efficient code. it would kinda be like designing the exterior armor of a spaceship except we work in adtech. It's pretty close.","Our tech stack is ever evolving and always open to change. For now, here's what we're running: 


React 

Our products are built using React. We find the modular nature of react refreshing to develop in. Allowing us to break applications into very small component level pieces which helps us more easily isolate tasks when multiple developers are working in the same code base, helps us better update and extend features, and generally makes the DX much more enjoyable. 


Redux 

We use Redux for application state management. This enables us to centrally track changes in state to the application and adjust the UI based on these changes. Coupled with local component state we find this a very powerful tool in our arsenal and generally like to use it with wrapping HOCs.  


JSS 

JSS is how we style our UI. We find the integration with the component based architecture of React to be incredibly useful. Stylesheets are broken into small fragments that are grouped together with the component they'll be styling. Ultimately just JavaScript, this means we can dynamically update styles with great ease as well as import and extend code.","What we're looking for in a candidate? 


Someone who cares 

We don't want candidates who just see this as a job. You should care about the quality of work you produce. You have to be driven to create something you're proud to show to others. You have to be willing to work hard and smart. 


Someone who owns their work 

A person who goes the extra mile to communicate to intra/cross team members when they feel it's necessary, calls out things that are concerning, and generally does what's right for the product and code. 


Dedication to craft 

You should be fanatic about the quality of code you write. Efficiency, conciseness, composability, modularity, extensibility, readability are some words that come to mind. If these things matter to you, you're who were looking for. 


High level of skill 

We need an impact player. Someone who can come in and code amazing things quickly, help us move our product along at a higher rate of speed, and be an autonomous contributor when necessary.  


Experience 

- Strong knowledge in Javascript fundamentals (ES6 preferred) 

- Strong experience building production ready applications, specifically in React 

- Experience with responsive, single page, event driven web applications 

- Experience with asynchronous data-driven actions 

- Ability to replicate designs to a pixel and hand write stylesheets in a maintainable fashion

Our Operations team starts with the big picture, before narrowing it to reflect an organization's most pressing concerns, including growth acceleration, process and system redesign, cost optimization and operational strategy.

L'ARCHE: PEOPLE WITH DIFFERING ABILITIES TRANSFORMING LIVES - TRANSFORMING SOCIETY 

We welcome Assistants to live, work, and learn together with men and women with developmental disabilities in our communities.  Founded by Jean Vanier in 1964, L'Arche strives to shape a more human and just society. 


""Community Assistant"" Role Description: 


Assistants support Core Members (men and women with developmental disabilities) in their daily life.  We cook and eat dinner together, get together with friends, participate in activities in our neighbourhoods, go on vacation together, and celebrate often. 


L'Arche brings together people from different cultures, ages, genders, abilities, faiths, and invites all of these people to create community together. Through friendship and relationships with Core Members, Assistants gain valuable life skills and opportunities for personal growth and leadership.  All new Assistants participate in the L'Arche Leadership Development Program. 


Shannon Seager worked at L'Arche for her Cooperative Education work term and says: 

""The last 4 months have been the most challenging but more importantly, the most rewarding time of my life.  The experience I had here at L'Arche Hamilton has changed my perspective of myself and the world.  I have discovered the kind of person I want to be and the kind of life I would like to live."" 

Why choose to come to one of the communities in Québec?

Improve your French, with weekly support if needed. 

Get to know another culture 

Meet and share life with Francophones from around the world. Share your experiences and knowledge and have a truly life changing experience. 

Formation: There will be regular one-to-one mentoring sessions for first 3 months of the placement (once every two weeks) and then less frequently afterwards.  These are opportunities to discuss the rewards and challenges of the placement.","This is a live-in position whereby you share life as you would in a normal home setting with individuals with and without developmental disabilities.  The assistants (care-providers) are living in the home 6 of 7 days / week.  Assistants have the same responsibilities as one would have in any home (i.e. cooking and cleaning), but more importantly have the responsibility of spending time getting to know people in the home, sharing time and activities together, and learning about themselves as they discover that they can just be themselves and be valued for who they are.  As an assistant, one does not go home after a day of work, because home is also the place where one works.  Assistants have a bedroom that is their private space within a L'Arche home. 


We offer an exceptional and life changing adventure in friendship and self-discovery.  L'Arche is your opportunity to make a meaningful difference in the world while having an experience that is so much more than a job! 


L'Arche is 

- a way of life rather than a work place 

- a place of reflection and action 

- a place of self discovery through being with people 

- a place where you are valued and appreciated for who you are 

- a place where practical skills develop in conjunction with a willingness to be challenged and an openness to change","Training:  

We will provide training for First Aid & CPR; Crisis Prevention Intervention (CPI), and the possibility of further formation and training. 


Requirements: 

We hire people from a wide variety of educational backgrounds. 

We are looking for people with an open attitude, a desire to grow, and who want to make a difference 

Basic knowledge of French, fluency is not required 

Training is provided through the L'Arche Leadership Development Program 

Pre-employment requirements:  

Criminal reference check (vulnerable sector).

We welcome Assistants to live, work, and learn together with men and women with developmental disabilities in our communities.  L'Arche strives to shape a more human and just society by offering people of different abilities a life changing experience of companionship, community, belonging and fun.  


Role Description: 

Assistant teams support Core Members (men and women with developmental disabilities) in their daily life. We cook and eat dinner together, get together with friends, participate in activities in our neighbourhoods, go on vacation together, and celebrate often.  At L'Arche, people with and without intellectual disabilities live together creating communities of friendship and belonging.

Assistants receive at least two hours of personal time each day, as well as two days off per week. (This is simply a time away from responsibilities - Assistants may stay in the house as they like during this time or go elsewhere.) Assistants have a bedroom that is their private space within a L'Arche home. 


Daily rhythm and responsibilities are much like in any household where members of the household require personal care support:
 

Assisting Core Members with their morning and evening routines
Assisting with bathing and using the toilet as needed
Supporting Core Members in following the direction of medical professionals including administering medication
Cooking & cleaning
Grocery shopping
Yard work as required

More importantly Assistants have the responsibility of building community by spending time getting to know people in the home, participating in the spiritual life of the home and community, sharing activities together, and learning about themselves and others as they discover that they can just be themselves and be valued and appreciated for who they are.

							",8 month consecutive work term preferred,"At Left Turn Right Turn (LTRT), our mission (and yours, should you choose to accept it!) is to get people out of cars and onto transit. We work with transit agencies to understand their service, and plan, design, and implement improvements to the customer experience and operations. Transit Explorers support a wide range of projects and get full exposure to the glamorous life (or so we tell each other) of a consultant as part of a fun and dynamic team working with Canada's largest and smallest transit agencies.  

  

Projects delivered in the past year include:
 

Undertaking a regional planning exercise and governance review for multiple agencies
Developing a technology roadmap and organizational plan
Crafting an accessibility policy and developing an accessibility program
Undertaking operational and business process reviews of transit scheduling and dispatch
Assessing on-demand transit opportunities for low-density geographic areas
Analyzing and preparing capital infrastructure plan including fleet plan

  

Our DNA

The LTRT team is creative, collaborative, and balanced - it's in our DNA.  

  

Creative: We look for new ideas and methods to inject at the start of each project. This keeps things fresh and relevant for the client, and exciting and interesting for us. We innovate in the work that we do because one can, and one should, always strive to improve.  

  

Collaborative: We communicate effectively, whether in-person, in writing, or by smoke signal. We mix working meetings and workshops regularly into our projects to keep us in sync internally as well as with clients. Most importantly, we'll support each other during crunches so no one bears the load alone. 

  

Balanced: We value a balanced approach to work and life. We'll crack a joke when the time is right, and crack down when it's not. We'll follow up that long work week with necessary recovery time off (with some food, drinks, and the occasional board game to accelerate the process!).","Transit Explorers will support and learn through a wide variety of projects, applying their smarts, experience, and creativity at a culture-focused firm. Your responsibilities could include:
 

Researching and documenting cutting-edge industry best practices through the beauty of the interweb, phone, or in-person interviews with vendors and agencies.
Analyzing operational, financial, horoscope, and other data to derive insights.
Evaluating niche transit software systems, from the perspective of contract compliance, system accessibility, or the 'cool-factor'.
Writing technical and non-technical reports that bring a (figurative) tear to the reader's eye.
Crafting and designing breath-taking, head-turning powerpoint presentations and workshop materials.
Researching, reviewing, and summarizing key findings from documents such as Official Plans and Transit Master Plans.
Developing jaw-dropping, project-winning proposals.","Qualifications

Have an interest in public transit issues (bonus points if you have a model railroad collection).
A superb eye for detail and accuracy (like, seriously, ok).
Excellent writing and communication skills, with a knack for translating technical concepts to a non-technical audience (consulting = smart report writing, it's true).
Experience in analyzing data using Excel.
Demonstrated problem-solving and decision-making skills.
Ability to work independently as well as in team environments.
Bonus gold stars if you have graphic communication skills (infographics, charts, and graphs), GIS analysis, or killer Excel skills.

Level is an employer-sponsored benefit that allows people to easily find, manage, and pay for care. We're first tackling dental because it's an often-ignored segment of healthcare that accounts for over $100 billion in US spending each year. Our team includes smart, passionate people that includes former employees from Square, Oscar, and Uber. We're backed by top investors, including First Round Capital and Homebrew. We've seen amazing feedback from early customers in our first few months in the market. 


How we work

We love working with engineers who delight in writing constructive comments as much as writing elegant code, who thoughtfully define API specifications, and who articulate the rationale behind their engineering decisions. 


As a company, we pride ourselves on collaboration. We believe you bring a valuable, thoughtful perspective to the conversation. We look to your experience and insights to help elevate the quality of our work and our impact when solving problems for customers. 


If it interests you, there are also opportunities to wear hats outside of engineering - for example, anything from product development to business strategy.  


Our community

Level is bringing together talented, passionate people from diverse backgrounds. We're looking for teammates who are naturally curious and love to ask questions, even when it means challenging the established way of doing things. We foster a work environment where every voice in the room is heard and encourage people to have a strong sense of ownership over their work. We believe in an inclusive culture where all team members can grow, contribute, and feel valued.

We develop cutting-edge, intelligent games that leverage technology to create novel and deep experiences for smart players. 


We're the creators of Prismata: a multiplayer strategy game that blends elements of RTS, deckbuilders, and board games (check it out on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/490220/Prismata) 


Our upcoming project (codenamed ""Sophia"") is a multiplayer first-person puzzle game for PC and consoles incorporating some elements of MMOs, escape rooms, and battle royale games. We're looking to hire throughout 2021 for a number of roles for the project (engineers, designers, producers, artists, etc.) and love working with talented co-op students who can add value to the project. 


Ideal candidates are highly intelligent, passionate about games, and capable of getting lots of work done quickly with new and unfamiliar tools. We use Unreal Engine so any experience with it (or similar software like Unity) is a bonus. Possible projects could include network programming, AI, graphics, procedural generation, puzzle design, maps/environments, gameplay programming, 3d modeling/animation, UI/UX, player analytics, backend dev, etc. 


Lunarch has been operating remotely since 2016 and all positions will continue to be remote for the foreseeable future. 


We can provide assistance setting up a virtual office if necessary.  A good internet connection is important.","Key Responsibilities:
 

Assist with the development of a high-fidelity PC/console video game
Design puzzles and other gameplay features
Contribute to the creative process of building a large open world multiplayer puzzle game
Document and fix bugs
Get a lot of work done in a remote environment

You might be surprised to know that Co-ops love Manulife ? and come back term after term. Why? We've got what you're looking for:
 

Jobs that embed you in passionate, productive teams.
Jobs with lots of opportunities for growth during your co-op term and opportunities for fulltime employment after graduation.

You question everything. Not in an annoying way of course, but in a way that gets to the root of an issue, so you can go do something about it.
You're an all-round super star: a passionate, team player with a zeal for designing, developing and improving cool software products.
You are always learning by using new tools and technologies.
You know that part of innovation is failure. And when you fail, you always fail forward and fast? learning something new and becoming even better than you were before.
You will have the opportunity to innovate and figure things out creatively with your team. You'll analyze a problem, find the best solution, and implement it. Then you iterate and do again.

You take pride and ownership in the work that you do.  You're not just looking to cross items off a ""to-do"" list.  You want to build software that satisfies users, write code that is easily testable, and provide functionality that doesn't cause the support team to pull their hair out.","What do we offer?

We can't afford to give you ""busy-work"" projects.  You'll be working on our core products and making an actual impact on the lives of our customers.

Product ideas come from all sorts of places.  Customers may request new features, product managers may dream up new functionality and designers may think of better ways to present information.  We believe an excellent approach is to watch what customers actually do with our product and improve their experience.  To instrument our product gives us detailed information on what customers are looking at most often and what features they're making use of. 
 

Want to be a part of the team who use that information to improve the product by simplifying navigation to commonly used features, improving the discoverability of functionality and adding new tools to help users reach their goals?
Do you want to help track new product introduction, key performance indicators against Martello's business goals to help us achieve 'success'? 

Just another way you can have your work become part of the product and make a positive impact on the customer experience.","Required Skills:  We use C#, ASP.MVC, SQL, PowerShell and HTTP, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, AngularJS, AngularJS Material HTTP, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, AngularJS, AngularJS Material, and a whole bunch of other nifty and interesting technologies.  We don't necessarily care if you have experience in them, we appreciate people who want to grow and can quickly learn.","Targeted Clusters
