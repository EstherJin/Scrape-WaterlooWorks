							",4 month work term,"Look under the hood of almost any software project and you'll find a database.  In the world of Big Data, databases are everywhere: tracking your clicks on the Internet, analyzing genes, highlighting investment opportunities, serving up tempting deals at your favorite retailer.  More and more, these databases are in the cloud, where users enjoy low costs, the most up-to-date tools, and elastic access to unlimited compute and storage. 


Join us while we provide cutting edge data management and data analytics services hosted in the cloud.  Our products include SAP HANA Cloud (an in-memory relational database) and SAP Data Lake (which combines the computing speed of an in-memory database with the huge data capacity of a traditional disk-based database).  Our services run both on SAP's proprietary cloud and on hyperscalers like AWS, Azure and GCP. 


Running in the cloud means using the latest technologies to enable running at huge scale. Our software may be running on thousands of machines, in data centers across the globe.  At that scale, it is impractical to manually connect to a single machine to do anything.  Automation, self-healing algorithms and providing self-serve options are the keys to keeping the system running.  Creating user instances, rolling out software upgrades, rolling back buggy changes, recovering from hardware and software failures, monitoring performance and load are just some of the things we need to automate using microservices. This work offers tremendous opportunities to learn cloud technologies such as Go, Kubernetes, Docker, AWS, Azure and GCP. 


If you want to learn, build, and contribute to cloud software and database technology this is the job for you.  We are looking for people who are passionate about learning and problem solving.  We have lots of interesting problems to solve and we will work with you to identify tasks that match your interests and skills. 


We can't wait to see the solutions you'll create.

Market Risk Measurement, Global Risk Management is responsible for implementing models to quantify the risks in the Bank's trading activities. The main risks considered are:
Market risk. The risk associated with the Bank losing money due to adverse market movements negatively affecting the values of derivatives and assets held in its trading books
Counterparty credit risk. The risk associated with the Bank losing money due to being owed by its counterparties on derivatives and the counterparty not honoring its obligations due to default or other credit events
These two categories share many features since they both require simulation of future possible values of our portfolios of derivatives and trading assets. It is a very complex problem to do this in way which maintains rigor when looking at any one component but also rolls up correctly so that the view of risk aggregated across all positions also makes sense.

Based in the Silicon Valley, Sibros is a fast-growing venture backed automotive tech company led by an expert team from Faraday Future, Tesla, Uber and other leading auto-mobility brands. Our Deep Connected Mobility platform helps automakers manage all the software and data between vehicles and the cloud enabling advanced OTA (Over-the-Air) software updates, deep data collection, software inventory management, service management, remote diagnostics and beyond. At Sibros, you'll have the opportunity to work at the forefront of disruptive technology running on millions of vehicles and used by leading EV and autonomous startups to some of the world's largest and most prestigious automakers. 


Sibros and Waterloo have had a deep relationship. Several of our interns are returning Waterloo Interns who opt to get back to Sibros after having a very positive experience. We also have some Waterloo alumni returning as full time engineers after they graduate. We can almost guarantee that your experience at Sibros for firmware or embedded systems development will be second to none, and this can be verified by talking to former Waterloo students who have interned with us. 


At Sibros, we rarely work on ""bugs"" (seriously). We enforce 100% line and branch coverage on unit-tests, and this first barrier largely helps us avoid working on bugs, and thus the time is spent towards development of core technology rather than technical dept. You will feel proud having the experience Sibros can provide. We will spoil you with our state of the art development workflow, and make it really tough for you to pick another company after having worked at Sibros. 


We work hard, and play hard. We have game nights, team outings and many social events so you will build not just experience but life long friends. 


The Role


You will primarily be working in C, and C++. Our embedded systems run with C code, backed with purely static memory and 100% unit test quality. The higher end embedded systems which have POSX support run with C++ and the coding paradigm is very different in this area when compared to C language. In the C++ code aspects, we love working on the design and structure aspects much more than C and we use Google Test framework for the unit-tests. 


As a member of the firmware development team, you will be responsible for designing and developing firmware for the current and next generation of OTA and logging. Come join a team of deeply knowledgeable engineers that is striving to change the EV and automotive supplier eco-system by providing high-quality solutions to alleviate issues that plague the automotive industry today like high-costs, slow turn-around and development times, and use of legacy tools and software. 


At Sibros, we are building the most robust and reliable embedded systems using cutting edge software development tools and practices. You will solve some of the most ambiguous and challenging problems in the embedded software space and change the way the world designs, develops, produces and maintains electric vehicles.","Responsibilities

Deliver high-quality C code in a real-time embedded environment.
Work on C++ code particularly focused in design and structure.
Work on automated tests using Python test framework.
Specify, design, and implement functionality and behaviors of embedded subsystems.
Be involved in the full life-cycle of firmware development from concept through integration, test and high-volume manufacturing.
Hands-on hardware bring up, system debugging and code optimization.
Make performance and optimization trade-offs to meet product requirements.
Contribute to technical designs and ECU requirements, safety analysis, and interface design between various microcontrollers
Interface with hardware and mechanical engineering teams, as well as clients and end-users of the products","Requirements

Working towards a B.S. or MS in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Computer Science or similar.
All levels of experience are welcome.
Must-have requirements for candidates include proficiency in the following areas/aspects:
	 
  
C programming and proven record of delivering high quality code.
Git version control system
Embedded systems and low-level driver code
Computer Science principles like data structures and algorithms

							",4 month work term,"At SkyWatch we believe that everyone on the planet should benefit from the thousands of satellites that orbit the earth. Every day, hundreds of trillions of pixels of our planet are captured from space. And with new applications for this data emerging, such as precision farming, construction planning, disaster relief operations, and retail revenue prediction (to name a few), the demand for satellite imagery is growing. However, the current process to obtain satellite imagery remains time-consuming, costly and complex. 

  

SkyWatch is a post-series B, venture-backed space technology company in Waterloo, Canada, focused on the seamless and affordable distribution of satellite data to commercial markets, enabling businesses, applications, and solutions that were never before possible.  

  

The market for Earth Observation satellite data and services is projected to represent a $56B cumulative revenue opportunity over the next 10 years, growing to $7.2B annually in 2028 (source: NSR). The way we look at the world is changing - with more sensors and more data - and SkyWatch is at the forefront of creating the digital infrastructure to support this revolution.  


Our Products: 

Today, satellite imagery is expensive and difficult for customers to access and manage.  SkyWatch addresses these challenges through a multi-product strategy focused on both the supply and demand sides of ecosystem. 

  

EarthCache, an easy-to-use Application Programming Interface (""API""), allowing application developers and enterprises to programmatically integrate satellite imagery, from multiple imagery providers, into their software. 

TerraStream, a data infrastructure product that provides satellite operators with an integrated data storage, cataloging, ordering, processing and delivery solution, allowing them to serve customers faster, with less operational and financial risk. 

  

Our technology is enabling agriculture customers to monitor crop health; energy customers to monitor oil pipelines and solar farms; and global banks to monitor infrastructure development, among hundreds of other unique use cases. All from space, with just a few lines of code. 



Our Team:

 Let's face it, the best jobs boil down to a handful of things ? getting the chance to work with amazing people in a great culture with a leader who has your back, while pursuing a vision that you can get passionate about. 

  

Our team consists of NASA award-winning developers, Earth observation scientists, big data and unicorn startup veterans who come from ten different countries. Our leadership team includes leading figures in Canadian Space, a planetary robotics graduate from the International Space University, and a petabyte-scale data leader with patents in location AI and contextual analytics and we are just getting started! 


  

Our Culture:

Culture is the personality of a company. It is our company's shared beliefs, values, and practices. At SkyWatch, our culture is incredibly important to us, and we practice it every day. Both as a company and in our products we value simplicity, dependability, and empathy. 

A Few More Things to Know: 

  

Our HQ is, in normal times, located in Uptown Waterloo, at the Communitech Data Hub surrounded by other awesome Startups focused on Data, AI, Machine Learning, and IoT. Currently, we operate on a remote-first model with all employees working from home until our situation improves.  

We ""Hack the Sky"" (our internal hackathon), teaming up with our peers for 36 hours to build something awesome that doesn't pertain to our normal day-to-day work.

WHAT WE DO

We are a design strategy firm that is passionate about finding innovative solutions to the most challenging problems.

We're kind of a pain in the ass. We strive to dig deep into any problem we face to find the real opportunity. We work closely with our clients in open and honest dialogue to make sure we deliver what our clients need.

We are always learning and questioning. We believe that true innovation comes from being open to new ideas, constantly learning and challenging assumptions.

We don't take a ""one size fits all"" approach. You won't solve big problems by using standard innovation templates. Because every challenge is unique, we take an equally unique approach to finding the right solution.

We're a little weird. We are made up of inventors, strategist, software and hardware engineers, UI, UX, Visual, ID and Mechanical Designers. We can invent, design, create and build anything.

Ideas over egos. Open project design, everyone has a voice on every project we work on.

We push, advance, and challenge ideas. We create.","* Program and Project Management

							",4 month work term,"About Us 

SNOLAB is an international facility for world-class underground physics research and has an expanding 

programme in astroparticle physics and underground science. Located in an air-conditioned clean room 

2 km underground in the Vale Creighton Mine near Sudbury Ontario, with a suite of surface facilities and 

laboratories, SNOLAB is currently preparing for the next generation of experiments focusing on neutrino 

studies and the search for galactic dark matter. 


The Position 

Astroparticle physics experiments searching for rare events, such as neutrinoless double 

beta decay and dark matter particle interactions, have to be shielded from background 

radiation and have to exhibit a radioactive background as low as reasonably achievable. The 

material selection for the next generation of low-background experiments is becoming 

crucial to inform the final design of the shielding scheme and to estimate the ultimate 

background rate in the energy region of interest of the experiments. 

The XIA UltraLo1800 alpha detector allows a non-destructive screening of large surfaces. 

In fundamental physics experiments, such as neutrino and rare decay measurements, it is 

critical to minimize the number of background events that arise from alpha particle emitted 

by the natural radioactivity in the materials used to construct the experiment. The control of 

the contamination induced 222-Rn and its progenies in the environment where detectors are 

assembled and stored is thus a crucial issue. 

The SNOLAB material screening and assay program allows the direct measurement of the 

experimental background sources. The student will be involved in the data analysis and 

acquisition of material samples counted in the detector, currently located in a clean room at 

the SNOLAB surface building. 

Improved sensitivity to surface alpha contamination should be achieved bringing the alpha 

counter 2km underground at the SNOLAB underground laboratory. Sensitivity can reach 

level better than one order of magnitude than on surface, as demonstrated at YangYang 

Laboratory.","The student will play an active role in studying the sensitivity gain via 

MonteCarlo simulations and in moving the XIA UtraLo1800 detector underground at the 

SNOLAB underground laboratory. A first re-commissioning underground is needed to set the 

sensitivity standard level. The increased sensitivity level in alpha contamination will allow a 

qualitative material screening to inform for instance the final design of future experiments.","Expertise in data analysis, statistics and modern programming languages is required, ideally 

in the frame of C++, ROOT and Python. Experience working in a cleanroom laboratory is an 

advantage.","Targeted Clusters

							",4 month work term,"The SuperCDMS Collaboration has pioneered the use of low temperature phonon-mediated detectors to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and distinguish them from backgrounds. With this powerful technology, operating deep underground in the Soudan mine in Minnesota, CDMS II has provided the most sensitive WIMP search in the world, and this technology has the greatest discovery potential because it has achieved nearly background free performance. The upcoming SuperCDMS SNOLAB project is currently installing a new experimental apparatus in SNOLAB since 2019. The SuperCDMS SNOLAB experiment will improve the present sensitivity for dark matter WIMPs by two orders of magnitude. In the meantime, a cryogenic test facility (CUTE) is currently taking data underground at SNOLAB, in the vicinity of the SuperCDMS allocated space, testing SuperCDMS prototype detectors. The SNOLAB group is/will be supporting both CUTE and SuperCDMS installation, commissioning and science phases.","The student will be actively involved in the data acquisition, simulations and analysis of the CUTE test facility. She/he will play a leading role in understanding and mitigating the environmental backgrounds in CUTE and SuperCDMS. Protection against backgrounds is one of the key issues for the direct dark matter detection experiments. Estimation of the background from radioactive processes becomes a crucial task to inform the final shielding design of the forthcoming test facility and the background budget for the experiment. One of the main tools for background studies is the use of extensive simulation work. This can help with studying background suppression or rejection strategies, and investigation of requirements on the depth, the amount of active/passive shielding, the purity of materials, the veto efficiency, etc. for a given experiment. The SuperCDMS/CUTE group at SNOLAB actively contribute to the efforts to understand and limit the background via MonteCarlo simulations with GEANT4 to estimate radioactive background event rates from the main shielding scheme and via an intensive material and screening assay program. The student will help expanding the ongoing effort in the GEANT4 simulations in terms of neutron and gamma background to any material surrounding the detectors to better understand and estimate the radioactive background budget of the experimental apparatus. Simulation results will be then compared to the first science data. 


The student will be joining the activities at the underground laboratory during payload change of the CUTE tower, working in the cleanroom and with SuperCDMS prototype detectors whenever needed and the access to site is granted.","Expertise in data analysis, statistics and modern programming languages is required, ideally in the frame of C++, ROOT and Python.

The Position 

Searches for rare nuclear processes, such as neutrinoless double beta-decay and the 

interactions of WIMP dark matter, are motivating experiments with ever-decreasing levels of 

radioactive backgrounds. 

There are various methods to reduce or mitigate each of these sources. These mainly include 

the selection of very radio-pure materials to build the experiment and the detectors, detector 

technologies able to discriminate signal to background events and the choice of deep 

underground sites to locate the experiments. The depth of the laboratory provides a first 

protection from radioactive background: neutron and muon fluxes from cosmic rays are 

reduced by a few orders of magnitude by the rock overburden which filters them out. 

Furthermore, experiments use active and passive shielding schemes to moderate the 

environmental natural radioactivity. Usually, the flux of gamma-rays is attenuated by a lead 

shielding, whereas the radiogenic neutrons coming form the rock and materials close to the 

detectors by a polyethylene shielding material. In addition, active muon veto surrounding the 

experimental set-up will help tagging the residual muons that can interact in the lead shielding 

and then producing neutrons","The student will actively contribute to the efforts to understand and limit the background via 

MonteCarlo simulations with GEANT4 to estimate radioactive background event rates from

							",4 month work term,"Who We Are

We can accomplish anything, but we need the right tools and we need each other. Yet, most tools aren't designed for how we naturally think, and our coworkers are spread all over the world. Spatial breaks through these limitations, transforming work from how it is, to how it should be. In the process, teams grow closer, think bigger, and accomplish things faster. To push the world forward, we need to spend more time thinking and less time traveling. And to execute the next big idea, we'll need more space to think than a laptop or phone screen can provide.  


How does Spatial work?

Create a lifelike avatar and work as if next to each other. 

Transform your room into your monitor and then fill it with information. 

Use all of your favorite existing tools so your workflow remains intact. 

And use any device, including VR/AR headsets, your desktop, or your phone to participate.

Who we are
Although not a household name, State Street is one of the world's largest and most important financial services institutions, providing round-the-clock services to the global investment community. We touch $33 trillion in assets every day and are the world's third largest investment manager with over $2.8 trillion in assets under management. To do this we manage as much data as one of the internet giants on nearly as large a technical footprint.
 
Recently we launched one of the industry's largest technical transformation projects, in effect building a new bank from the ground up. This project isn't greenfield in the way most banks claim projects are; we've started with a blank sheet of paper both operationally and technically. We're using the same technologies that Silicon Valley giants are using: use of multiple public clouds, building our own private cloud to achieve even better performance, transforming our industry through distributed ledger technology and machine learning.
 
This isn't a traditional banking role. This is a chance to push your technical skills with people more comfortable in a technology firm than an investment bank, though solving real problems that affect anyone with any form of savings worldwide (not just trying to get people to click on ads).","What you will do

As a co-op data analyst, you will work as part of our development teams to help decipher sense and meaning from plethora of data streams and multitude of data repositories.
You will be able to demonstrate your ability to leverage Python and PySpark to build data pipelines to curate and transform data, build reporting constructs and take automated actions based on business rule.","Who you are

2+ years in Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics or a related engineering field
Strong showing in courses in Python and R

For TD Bank Group to grow profitably, it must selectively take and manage risks. TD recognizes that a strong risk culture and approach to risk management is fundamental to our success. 

  

The Retail Expected Loss Model Development group within the TD Bank Group (TDBG) Model Development department is responsible for modelling credit risk in all TDBG retail credit product portfolios (including mortgages, home equity, indirect auto loans, credit cards, and small business loans).","In this position, the individual will be responsible for the development, initial validation, documentation, and support in all stages of audit, implementation and ongoing monitoring of account-level models for credit risk parameters (PD, EAD, and LGD) for all TDBG retail credit product portfolios. The individual will also be responsible for updating/re-developing existing models for these portfolios as required. 

  

These predictive models serve as the basis for establishing default, exposure and loss parameter estimates for use in 

calculating Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA) for TDBG retail credit exposures under the Basel II AIRB approach. They will also be used to calculate loan loss allowance and economic capital for these portfolios, as well as calculate expected credit losses, RWA, loan loss allowance and economic capital under various macroeconomic scenarios included in the Bank's internal and regulatory stress tests. 

  

The position will involve interactions with TDBG Model Validation, Model Risk Management, Internal Audit, and external auditors, as well as with the Bank's Canadian (OSFI) banking regulators, in order to support their review and approval process for the risk parameter models. The position will ensure compliance with the TDBG Model Risk Policy, Capital Model Approval Policy, Data Governance requirements, and other relevant policies and regulatory requirements. 

  

The individual will closely work with and actively support TDBG Retail Risk Management, as well as retail credit product and finance areas by providing a deep analysis of credit risk drivers and parameters under various scenarios for the respective retail credit portfolios. This will entail discussing key observations and conclusions derived from the data analysis and modelling with the various retail credit product, finance, and risk management groups, and assisting these groups in managing product portfolio risk and profitability. 

  

The individual will use leading-edge technologies and develop innovative solutions in the following areas:

Data mining by making sense of large databases of historical data related to credit risk;
Predictive credit risk modelling based on rigorous statistical analyses of historical data, regression techniques, and econometric analyses;
Estimating credit risk embedded in the Bank's retail credit product portfolios, as well as the amount of regulatory and economic capital the Bank needs to allocate against these portfolios.

  

This position provides excellent learning, working and career opportunities in a highly professional and motivated team environment, as well as exposure to a variety of high-paced and intensive modelling projects and a variety of internal and external stakeholders.","Currently enrolled in an undergraduate degree majoring in Business, Statistics, Mathematics, Financial Analysis, Risk Management, Computer Science or equivalent
