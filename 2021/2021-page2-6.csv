As a Waterloo alum, I remember struggling to find co-ops where I could learn about the software industry, explore different business functions, have a meaningful impact, and get closer to the customers - especially the executives who sponsor large software purchases. So, I've come back to create precisely that.  


Atolio is an early stage software company, founded in 2019 by former engineers and early employees from Splunk ($30B company) and PagerDuty (uWaterloo alum) - having been part of the earliest team (under $1M in revenue) until IPO. Our first product is a platform for corporate information - integrated into your on-prem and cloud ecosystems (Microsoft, Google, Box, Atlassian, Slack, etc.) to help employees search, discover and organize information.  


This job is funded by the Government of Canada's Student Work Placement Program (SWPP). The SWPP program requires that candidates be a Canadian citizen, permanent resident or a protected person defined by the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.","We've figured out a remarkably effective way for startups at our stage to build relationships with potential clients - and you'll be mastering that process.  


You'll be working closely with our Head of Sales to research, contact, and meet with tech executives of the largest companies in the world. Using Salesforce, LinkedIn Sales Navigator, and other tools, you'll learn how to research and present to Chief Information Officers (CIOs) and Chief Technology Officers (CTOs) to hear what they have to say about our offering and to start building relationships into target accounts. 


Think of 80-90% of the job as an advanced research and sales role - beyond that we encourage you to engage with any part of Atolio that interests you. Examples from past co-op terms include an AFM student building out a chrome extension in JavaScript and Go to improve our sales process, a Psych major rethinking through our discovery questions and leading team building activities, a Biomedical engineering student analysing our hundreds of discovery calls to gather insights for our product efforts, and a double degree Business/CS student who analyzed trends in our dataset to better understand what leads to a higher quality conversation and future opportunity.

We strive to offer a well defined and easy to use API, and build highly available services that can support the scale of large OEMs. Our APIs are available in gRPC and REST, and our microservices are built using Java 11/Spring Boot 2, and communicate with each other by leveraging Kafka and GRPC. 


Command Adapter Team (TMS): Focused on building out adapter interfaces to enable our customers to integrate with the TMC Command functionality. We work closely with the business and our clients on improving our command definitions, and our services enable bi-directional communication for commands between our platform and a client's own cloud. Our system is designed to run at a global scale to support command conversion for millions of active vehicles. Our microservices are built using Java 11/Spring Boot 2, and communicate with each other by leveraging Kafka and GRPC. 


Command & Telemetry Team (CHAT): Focused on building APIs to facilitate customer interactions with Autonomic's platform. Some examples of functionality we expose are the ability to retrieve vehicle telemetry, to issue vehicle commands (start engine, lock, etc), and to administer groups of vehicles. We strive to offer well defined and easy to use APIs, and build highly available services that can support the scale of our customers. We currently offer APIs through REST and Websockets, and our microservices are built using Java 11/Spring Boot 2, and communicate with upstream services via REST, GRPC, and Kafka.

							",8 month consecutive work term preferred,"Avro Life Science is a Y Combinator, Bayer Pharmaceuticals, and Silicon Valley venture backed pre-clinical biotechnology startup developing novel transdermal drug delivery systems, focusing on the delivery of therapeutics for children and the elderly. Our mission is to bridge the gap between subcutaneous/intramuscular injections or intravenous infusions and optimal patient compliance through the development of more clinically effective and convenient drug delivery systems, in the form of transdermal patches. Our polymers serve to unlock the capabilities of the skin as a delivery route by enabling the delivery of non-ideal small molecules and small biologics in therapeutically relevant doses, fundamentally expanding the realm of possibilities for transdermal delivery, with opportunities to make an impact on patient lives in the near future.  


Avro has been named as one of the top 20 engineering projects internationally by the James Dyson Foundation, a member of the Kairos Society, and a member of Rotman's Creative Destruction Lab. We are a mission driven team of 14 based out of Kitchener/Waterloo, Ontario, working to improve patient health outcomes and quality of life through medication compliance, adherence, and therapeutic advantages afforded by effective drug delivery solutions. 


We are also interested in 8 month co-ops (preferrable, actually). If you are looking for a position for 8 months, please attach a cover letter, and mention this. 


We're looking for hard working, independent people who are handy in the lab and easy to work with otuside of the lab. At Avro, you get to take charge of a major aspect of the tech/project at hand, and bring it to life. If you love chemistry and biology and are fascinated by everything from advanced drug delivery methods to analytical techniques to materials sciences, you'll like it here.  


We value students who are able to work on a project and take full ownership of it, while maintaining flexibility and understanding the larger vision at Avro. As members of a quickly growing startup led by young founders, we place a lot of emphasis on culture - we want to make sure that you fit in with the team, and can enjoy your time working with us.  

  

The in-vitro testing and analytical chemistry coop will be responsible for validating the function of our patches using techniques including Uv-Vis spectroscopy, in-house diffusion cell testing, FTIR, HPLC, and more. A large portion of the job will involve running Franz diffusion tests at a high volume for in-vitro evaluation of our patches abilitties - this involves setting up the cells, preparing membranes for testing, sampling over the course of 72 hours, preparing buffers, and data collection. Enthusiastic students will gain significant exposure to analytical chemistry instrumentation for evaluation of the tests, and formulation development work for optiomization of our patches.  


The co-op will work with our analytical team to develop effective testing methods and procedures for primarily HPLC analysis of the samples obtained from our diffusion testing work, used to quantify the effectiveness and delivery ability of our patches. This position will require significant experience in method development, a fundamental understanding of chromatography techniques, and attention to detail throughout sample prep, development of calibration curves, method dev., etc. Previous experience in HPLC method dev, operation of Agilent 1100/1200 systems and GC/MS methodology, and SEC/GPC methodology is a significant asset.

Don't waste your time or our time with the former, as it will hurt your application, though we welcome the latter! 


We care about our co-ops at Avro - our previous students have contributed greatly to our tech, and are an essential part of our workflow. We give our students credits on research publications and patents, and do everything in our abilities to ensure that you have the best learning experience possible, and are well poised for the workforce/future co-ops.","Perform and optimize routine diffusion tests involving the preparation of skin samples, synthesis of transdermal patches, and assembly of Franz diffusion cells

The British Columbia Housing Management Commission (BC Housing) is a crown agency of the provincial government and is responsible for delivering a range of housing programs for British Columbians. BC Housing works in partnership with the private, non-profit and co-operative sectors, Indigenous communities, provincial health authorities and ministries, other levels of government and community groups to develop a range of housing options. New housing is created across the housing continuum, from supportive housing for the homeless to affordable rental and owner-purchased housing for middle income British Columbians. 

In delivering on our strategic direction and mandate, BC Housing is also committed to working in partnership with Indigenous peoples to embrace and implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC): Calls to Action. BC Housing is also committed to taking action towards the goals of equity, diversity, inclusion and belonging in the work we do, involving employees, our partners and the people we serve through our programs and services. BC Housing's commitment to sustainability is reflected in our Livegreen Housing Sustainability plan.  

The Executive Office supports the Chief Executive Officer with respect to responsibilities for the overall administration of staff and operations, strategy development, support to the Board of Commissioners to ensure good governance of BC Housing, and the new Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging (OEDIB). The Executive Office promotes effective liaison and relationship building with a broad range of external stakeholders and government representatives, and works with Vice Presidents, the senior management team and business areas to ensure effective alignment of corporate goals and strategies. It also liaises with Communications on sustainability communication, issues management and media relations. 

BC Housing's Sustainability & Resilience team is currently developing a Sustainability & Resilience Strategy Implementation Plan. Additionally, an external consultant team is assisting in the development of the internal and external engagement to support that work, and in particular the development of specific actions, KPIs and accountability metrics for each department within BC Housing. 

The work of this co-op student would be to develop the Sustainability and Resilience webinar series, that forms a critical part of this larger overall engagement strategy. The student would be assisting in planning and coordinating to engage both internal and external stakeholders in this webinar series, and the meetings with both internal and external stakeholders that will be necessary to develop it. The student will assist with the following research, engagement and planning activities that fit into the broader sustainability and resilience engagement planning process:","POSITION SUMMARY   

Reporting to the Senior Strategic Advisor, Sustainability & Resiliency, the Co-op Student provides practical, detail-oriented support to the research, planning and coordination of the Sustainability & Resilience Webinar series for BC Housing staff & partners, particularly for the Integrated Building Adaptation and Mitigation Assessment (IBAMA) and the Mobilizing Building Adaptation & Resilience (MBAR) initiatives. The student will support the development of staff and industry engagement events including the Sustainability & Resilience webinar series for BC Housing staff & partners. 

This is a webinars series which the student will assist in help to coordinate, research, develop and plan, which will include stakeholders that are both internal and external to BC Housing, and speakers and panelists on topics which may include, but are not limited to, the below, all of which will require the student to do research:
 

Resilience and adaptation in new and existing affordable housing: speakers may include architects, engineers, landscape architects, builders or others who have participated in notable projects, including, but not limited to, those who may have participated in the past in BC Housings' IBAMA or MBAR initiatives.
Using future climate data for design: what's new after BC's heatwave: speakers may include scientists that can give BC Housing direction on the best climate data sets to use.
Funding to support sustainable & resilient buildings: Current grant funding opportunities to support research, design and capital investment into sustainability and resilience initiatives that are applicable to BC Housing's ongoing expenditures into its portfolio of new and existing buildings, to support IBAMA and / or MBAR pilot projects which may require additional funding. This will involve research: a scan of provincial, municipal, federal and other funding currently available and speakers may be from the funding associations or they may include our external partners such as key stakeholders from local municipalities, local Indigenous groups, and internally key stakeholders will include development managers and directors. From there, it will involve putting together the webinar.
Other webinars on various sustainability and resilience issues: We would be looking for the student to do research into how other sustainability and resilience topics may or may not provide value to BC Housings' tenants and to BC taxpayers, such as:
	 
  
Indigenous approaches to sustainable and resilient design,
Standards such as passive house, living building challenge,
Strategies such as blue / green infrastructure, prefabricated design, modular housing
Leading technologies to adapt to extreme heat and smoke, such as heat pumps, misters, landscaping (blue / green infrastructure) solutions to create shade and reduce urban heat island, etc.



A final report will include a high-level overview of each of the webinar topics, the research that the student did on these, and the engagement / webinar that was planned. This co-op student posting counts as one work term. 


Knowledge & Skills:  

 

Research, including ability to locate and use databases, government websites, scholarly journals, news sites. Ability to review and summarize complex ideas into plain language.
Highly organized (seems this position is significantly about managing logistics recording, tracking speakers, taking action on decisions and direction?)

Demonstrated ability to function well as a member of a team and to receive constructive feedback.

Experience in event or conference organizing or public or stakeholder engagement, including a wide range of stakeholders.

							",4 month work term,"What's Bench? Check us out in Medium, Betakit, Financial Post, Fintech Impact, Perkins + Will, BC Business, our Instagram, and our Blog. 


We acknowledge that Bench headquarters is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples, including the territories of the x?m?θkw?y??m (Musqueam), Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish), and S?l?ílw?ta?/Selilwitulh (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations.


Our mission is to make a profound difference in the quality of life of one million people, by removing the financial complexity of entrepreneurship. Businesses need to understand their financial performance, but for many smaller ones, this means a trade-off between doing their books and running their businesses.  


Bench solves this dilemma by taking bookkeeping off of their hands. Learn more about us on our About page.  


We're growing fast, and we're looking for exceptional people to join us on this incredible journey. Check out our culture guide to learn more about what it's like to work at Bench! 


What does the Quality Team look like?


The Quality Team has one purpose: to permanently improve the quality of Bench's bookkeeping. Achieving this objective will ensure every Bench client receives financials that meet our high bookkeeping standards, and Associates across Operations are supported in their ongoing learning and development. 


You'll be a good fit for the Quality Team if you're ready for the next stage of your own learning and development. You'll be a great fit if you strive to make the Associates around you better through honest feedback and thoughtful communication. You've come to recognize that the only way for our clients to receive great books, is to have great Associates completing those books and knowledgeable Associates reviewing those books. 


We're a team of curious Benchmates who relish encountering a new bookkeeping challenge. You will be asked to develop your bookkeeping and accounting knowledge to the point where you can help any Associate with any bookkeeping issue.  


The Quality team reviews all Bench clients several times a year, including completing year-end reviews during tax season. We see it all, we strive to improve it all, and we always assume best intentions when sharing feedback with others. 


The Extra Details:

This is a 4 month contract position (Jan - end of Apr, 2022) for folks currently enrolled in a co-op work term
Worried about not having the experience for the role? Don't fret, we'll train you during our in-house Bench Operations Academy; you'll be up and running in no time
All Benchmates have access to Inkblot Therapy, our virtual counselling service to support mental wellbeing, and Bravely, our confidential, on-demand, 1:1 professional coaching service.
Our office is currently fully remote! We'll set you up with all the equipment you need to be productive at home from day one

We believe that unchecked biases disproportionately impact the most marginalized people in society-including but not limited to BIPOC, LGBTQ2S+ people, immigrants, and people with disabilities. We strongly encourage applications from people with these identities or other marginalized communities because we believe that without you, we are all less. At Bench, we don't stand for tokenism. We stand for representation.","What you'll be getting up to as a Quality Associate:

Communicating feedback to bookkeepers on the books you're reviewing in a concise and plain-spoken manner. 
Identifying themes of common issues or errors that you see while reviewing and communicating the pain-point you've seen to others on the Quality Team.
Providing input on projects that affect how you work in your day-to-day or the affect how the average Operations Associate works in their day-to-day. 
Completing reviews is the main task we ask you to do. You'll be completing a wide variety of reviews: MERs, YERs, CU reviews, Pro reviews, and possibly even YEFs. Completing reviews is what you do, but the purpose of the role is to ensure our clients are receiving high quality books and provide feedback to associates.","To be successful in this role, you'll need to have:

Bookkeeping Knowledge: Excited by numbers, simple math, or problem-solving and are content with repeat, detailed work. Accounting or finance background is an asset
Attention to Detail: Incredible attention to detail combined with a sense of urgency to get constructive feedback to as many Associates as possible
People focused Attitude: An open-minded and team-oriented attitude to work with fellow Quality Team members and the desire to support all of Operations.
Independence: The ability to work independently, but still ask for support when needed.","Targeted Clusters

",Bench Accounting,Divisional Office,6,Open for Applications,Vancouver,"Junior, Intermediate",26,"
								Sep 21, 2021
								
							",8 month consecutive work term required,"What's Bench? Check us out in Medium, Betakit, Financial Post, Fintech Impact, Perkins + Will, BC Business, our Instagram, and our Blog. 


We acknowledge that Bench headquarters is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples, including the territories of the x?m??kw?y??m (Musqueam), Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish), and S?l?ílw?ta?/Selilwitulh (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations.


Our mission is to make a profound difference in the quality of life of one million people, by removing the financial complexity of entrepreneurship. Businesses need to understand their financial performance, but for many smaller ones, this means a trade-off between doing their books and running their businesses.  


Bench solves this dilemma by taking bookkeeping off of their hands. Learn more about us on our About page.  


We're growing fast, and we're looking for you to join us on this incredible journey. 


What you'll be getting up to as an Associate:

At Bench, we really believe that people are everything, and our Accounting Associates play one of the most pivotal roles; providing the right mix of elegant and intelligent client assistance, and delivering bookkeeping for small businesses using our revolutionary software and app. Our Associates are directly responsible for helping our clients survive and thrive through monthly and historical bookkeeping. This is important now, more than ever. 


You'll maintain relationships with small business owners from various industries, both on the phone and through our proprietary bookkeeping platform. With or without an accounting background, we'll provide you with all the tools and training you'll need to be a highly successful Associate.  


In a typical week, Associates will spend roughly 60% of their time completing bookkeeping tasks, 30% of their time communicating with clients, and 10% of their time in meetings or training.","A highly successful Associate looks something like this:

Excited by numbers, simple math, or problem-solving, and are content with repeat, detailed work
Be able to communicate clearly and articulately on the phone and in messaging. (Note: We do not believe in the idea of ""standard"" accents for the English language.)
Motivated to build a global success story with us. Working for a start-up requires flexibility and resilience
Data driven: if you're someone that thrives off of metrics, statistics, and quarterly targets then you'll fit right in. 
A people-centered approach: you understand that people are everything. You're collaborative, optimistic and you listen to understand, demonstrating kindness and empathy in all interactions.
A drive to make things better: You're not satisfied with ""good enough"", and nothing that needs fixing is just someone else's job. You love to experiment, try new things, and drive improvement; within your own team, and across the organization.
Startup hustle: You are highly motivated, proactive, comfortable with change and ambiguity. You have a humble, team-player attitude and are ready to pitch in wherever you are needed most
Constant learning: This role is as challenging as it is rewarding. As long as you're someone who's eager to tackle new challenges and quick to learn new concepts, we'll get you up to speed in no time.","What's next: 

We will review your application, and if you are successful, a Recruiter will be in touch to schedule a first-round Zoom interview with our recruiter. 
Following a successful first interview, there will be a second Zoom interview with two of our hiring managers. You can expect an interactive activity as part of the interview at this stage. 

The Extra Details:

This is an 8 month contract position for folks currently enrolled in a co-op work term
All Associates joining the team will start at a base salary of $42,300. From there, with the Tax Season Bonus and Variable Pay, the On Target Earnings (OTE) for the role is $48,300- pro-rated to the length of your contract.
This position also offers an extended benefits package that includes health, dental, and vision.
All Benchmates have access to Inkblot Therapy, our virtual counselling service to support mental wellbeing, and Bravely, our confidential, on-demand, 1:1 professional coaching service.
Our office is currently fully remote, so we'll set you up with everything you need to work from home, from day one.
Please apply directly to our website: https://bench.co/careers/job/?gh_jid=3436304

We strongly encourage applications from people with these identities or other marginalized communities because we believe that without you, we are all less. At Bench, we don't stand for tokenism.

From shadowing the Pedorthic team, I observed clinical procedures and made connections that enhanced the concepts taught from my undergraduate studies. My involvement within the orthotics assembly process, as well as patient assessments, facilitated my growth as a Co-op student. BioPed provided an excellent opportunity to develop the fundamental experiences of a health care provider.""

""My experience at BioPed was absolutely amazing. I was given the opportunity to learn about Pedorthics and Chiropody, two career paths I was unaware of prior to working there. I was a little nervous when starting as it was my first work term, however the staff at BioPed were very friendly and welcomed me in with open arms. I learned so much about lower limb injuries and treatments, bracing options, and even how to work with vendors and insurance companies throughout the work term. I would highly recommend working at BioPed if given the chance!""

""Prior to this work term, I had never been exposed to the field of Pedorthics and Chiropody and was quite unfamiliar with what these professions have to offer. Working at Bioped has now opened an entirely new perspective of healthcare which I did not consider before. Throughout my time here, I have been able to see and experience first-hand all the hard work that is put in to provide patients with nothing but the most effective solutions to address their problems and concerns. Whether it was through fabrication of orthotics, sitting in on assessments or dealing with customer retail, each day brought a new experience to learn from, which piqued my interest and kept me engaged.

							",4 month work term,"BioRender is a Toronto-based high growth startup backed by Y Combinator.  


At BioRender, our mission is to empower the world to learn and communicate science faster through visuals. BioRender software reduces the time it takes to visually communicate research from hours to minutes, while also making that communication more effective. 


We aim to save scientists over 1 billion hours of wasted time per year so they can spend it performing life-changing medical research, teaching the scientists of tomorrow, and helping people understand the world around them. 


To support the mission, we have ~20 engineers across 4 teams tackling a variety of challenges. We're remote-first and have team members in 3 provinces. A physical office in Toronto is available, but you have the flexibility to work from anywhere.  We're hiring coops for all 4 of our teams: 
 

The Editor team creates web-based interactive tools for communicating science  ( think rendering, caching,  drawing and editing tools ). 
The App Experiences team enables teams of scientists to organize their content, collaborate, and manage their accounts ( think tools like commenting, sharing and organizing content, identity and access management )
The DevOps/Infrastructure team builds out low-latency services for real-time collaboration, and ensures our AWS infrastructure scales with our user base.
The Growth and Acceleration team ingests and analyzes huge amounts of telemetry and usage data.  The insights from this data inform all of our decisions and help us optimize the user experience for scientists.

This posting is for our DevOps team. We're looking for an engineer interested in designing and building out services in AWS that scale to hundreds of thousands of concurrent users! 


We write services in TypeScript running in Node.js, using Express and WebSockets, and use AWS-managed services for: docker, container orchestration, kafka, Dynamo DB, CI/CD, and infrastructure-as-code.","Our ideal fit:

Excellent technical communication skills
Ability to explain complex solutions clearly to others
Growth mindset, excited to learn new libraries / technologies
Creative problem solver

What you'll be doing:

Participate in architecture and system design discussions and evaluate tradeoffs between different design choices.
Build out new services end-to-end: from initial design, architecture review, development, testing (including load-testing), to production go-live.   For example, last term's coop built a real-time push notification service using Kafka. 
Build tooling that boosts developer velocity, making it easier for all our teams to develop, integrate, and deploy using AWS. Examples include CI/CD improvements, zero-downtime deployments, and system observability improvements (logging, monitoring, alerting). 
Peer review code, participate in team meetings and contribute to team efforts around code quality improvements","What you bring to the table:

You've had some professional experience with (or done challenging side projects using) AWS, and want to take that experience to the next level.
You're comfortable working in TypeScript or JavaScript
