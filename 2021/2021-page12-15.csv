Faire is an online wholesale marketplace built on the belief that the future of retail is local. There are over 1M independent retailers in the U.S. and Canada doing more than twice the revenue of Walmart and Amazon combined. At Faire, we're using the power of technology and data to connect a growing community of over 170,000 brands and independent retailers around the world. Picture your favorite boutique in town - we help them discover the best products to sell in their stores. By empowering entrepreneurs with the right tools and insights, we believe that we can level the playing field so that small businesses can compete with big box and e-commerce giants. We're looking for smart, resourceful and passionate people to join us as we power the shop local movement. If you believe in community, come join ours. 

Faire was founded in 2017 by a team of early product and engineering leads from Square. We're backed by some of the top investors in retail and tech including: Y Combinator, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Forerunner Ventures, Khosla Ventures, Sequoia Capital, Founders Fund, and DST Global. We have headquarters in San Francisco and Kitchener-Waterloo, and a global employee presence across offices in Salt Lake City, Atlanta, Toronto, London UK and Sao Paulo. 


About this role
We are fast-moving and you'll have the opportunity to complete entire features (many of them), giving you great work to show off after you're done.

You'll get more real-world experience here than in any other co-op. But this means we need smart people, who love to learn and who aren't afraid of a challenge.","What you'll do 
As a Back-end engineer, you will deliver core features of our JVM server in Kotlin (with some Java 8). You will work with a state of the art backend written from scratch to be high performance, scalable, capable of serving a high-traffic ecommerce website. This is all custom, no frameworks (e.g., no Spring), and no legacy code. You will work closely with the Front-end team to design new APIs, and with the product team on the user experience.

We're looking for co-op students who would love the opportunity to take ownership over entire features and get their code into production. 

You will learn more here than maybe any other co-op position, because you'll be given the autonomy and responsibility to do real coding and design. You can shadow our world-class devs and learn from the best. Then you can take an entire feature and do it on your own as soon as you're ready.","- Experience with Java or C# is a must.
- Good understanding of algorithms, data structures, and OO design.

							",4 month work term,"About Faire


Faire is an online wholesale marketplace built on the belief that the future of retail is local. There are over 1M independent retailers in the U.S. and Canada doing more than twice the revenue of Walmart and Amazon combined. At Faire, we're using the power of technology and data to connect a growing community of over 170,000 brands and independent retailers around the world. Picture your favorite boutique in town - we help them discover the best products to sell in their stores. By empowering entrepreneurs with the right tools and insights, we believe that we can level the playing field so that small businesses can compete with big box and e-commerce giants. We're looking for smart, resourceful and passionate people to join us as we power the shop local movement. If you believe in community, come join ours.  


Faire was founded in 2017 by a team of early product and engineering leads from Square. We're backed by some of the top investors in retail and tech including: Y Combinator, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Forerunner Ventures, Khosla Ventures, Sequoia Capital, Founders Fund, and DST Global. We have headquarters in San Francisco and Kitchener-Waterloo, and a global employee presence across offices in Salt Lake City, Atlanta, Toronto, London UK and Sao Paulo.  



About this role

We are fast-moving and you'll have the opportunity to complete entire features (many of them), giving you great work to show off after you're done. 


You'll get more real-world experience here than in any other co-op. But this means we need smart people, who love to learn and who aren't afraid of a challenge.","What you'll do 

As a Back-end engineer, you will deliver core features of our JVM server in Kotlin (with some Java 8). You will work with a state of the art backend written from scratch to be high performance, scalable, capable of serving a high-traffic ecommerce website. This is all custom, no frameworks (e.g., no Spring), and no legacy code. You will work closely with the Front-end team to design new APIs, and with the product team on the user experience. 


We're looking for co-op students who would love the opportunity to take ownership over entire features and get their code into production.  


You will learn more here than maybe any other co-op position, because you'll be given the autonomy and responsibility to do real coding and design. You can shadow our world-class devs and learn from the best. Then you can take an entire feature and do it on your own as soon as you're ready.","- Experience with Java or C# is a must. 

- Good understanding of algorithms, data structures, and OO design. 

- Bonus: experience with high-performance server code at scale (when we say scale, we mean ecommerce site scale).  

- Bonus: experience with web server architecture, APIs, TDD, SQL, dependency injection.

If you are eager to work on innovative projects and be part of a great team, Graham is the place for you. 

  

We have a Student opportunity with our Davenport Diamond project. The Davenport Diamond refers to the intersection where the Barrie GO corridor meets the CP Rail tracks. It is one of the busiest train intersections in North America. To support future two-way all-day GO service on the Barrie line and solve the congestion problem, Graham is building a raised guideway for GO trains above the CP tracks. This project is part of Metrolinx's GO Expansion program and represents an important transit infrastructure commitment that will improve service on the Barrie GO line while adding to the vitality of the community. The Davenport Diamond Guideway project includes construction of a new rail grade separation between GO Transit's Barrie line and CP Rail's North Toronto subdivision, as well as the addition of a second main line track on the Barrie line. To allow construction of the new grade separation in a logistically challenging site with an active rail line, Graham had to construct a temporary diversion track within the existing rail corridor so that Barrie train service can continue. The scope of work also includes staged demolition and reconstruction of a rail over road bridge at Bloor Street, and rehabilitation of rail over road bridges at Dupont Street and Davenport Road. Once the grade separation is complete, new public space and multi-use trails that enhance community experience will be constructed through the rail corridor, connecting neighbourhoods and promoting the area as a civic destination.

1) Insane variety of projects and industries. ML, backend, frontend, infra, data eng, blockchain. It's an all-you-can-learn buffet. Working for 2-8 different companies in one term? It's possible. 

2) We pay more than most big US companies. They cut their co-op salaries ""because it's remote in Canada"". We don't think you're worth any less just because you live outside of SF/NYC.

3) Real responsibility and impact. It's a cliche, but you'll be the same as a full-timer. No busywork or ""intern projects"". You'll demo your work directly to our clients.

4) Truly flexible hours. Wake up and start work at 1pm if you want :)

5) Truly remote. Work wherever you want. Time zones aren't a problem because of #4. Need to be with family across the world? Family comes first. Surfing in Hawaii? Do it, and show us pics!

6) If you know, you know. 1-on-1 mentorship from the legendary Anthony Zhang, the creator of the famous CS course notes that saved us all.

7) We put the hype in hypotenuse. Jokes + camaraderie <3

8) Learn how the business side works. We'll shield you from politics but if you're interested, come learn how we deal with it.

9) You're important to us. Many of us have been thrown under the bus before by negligent bosses at various companies. It's soul-crushing. We're not perfect, but we always own up to our mistakes, take responsibility, and make it right.

10) Free housing? If you're ok with travelling or nomading, we'll sponsor your housing in certain countries!

Bonus) Bonus? Yes, we dish out bonuses for killer performance :)
