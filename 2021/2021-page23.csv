",On Deck,Divisional Office,2,Open for Applications,Remote in Canada,Senior,20,"
								Sep 21, 2021
								
							",4 month work term,"TL;DR: Fast-growing early-stage startup seeking Fullstack Software Engineer. In doing so, we'll empower the most ambitious people in the world to build the future. Details below! 


About On Deck

On Deck is on a mission to build a modern education institution for the future of work. 

Today, On Deck has become the place top talent and ambitious builders go to accelerate their ideas and careers, empowered by a world-class community of their peers. 


More about us: www.beondeck.com & www.beondeck.com/careers


Read about our most recent round of fundraising from Packy McCormick at Not Boring here. 


When people join On Deck, they're joining a community that will serve their professional needs through the twists and turns of a career - equipped with the skills, network, knowledge, and tools to support them along the way. 


Our Community Platform team is building the next generation of social network with the On Deck Universe as our userbase. As opposed to showcasing just the highlights of your life in an unrealistic way, or convincing you to scroll mindlessly, On Deck has just one goal when building product for our community - helping them achieve their personal and professional goals. The goal of our product is to match and connect people with the answers, information, resources, and people to realize their potential. 


On Deck is fundamentally only as strong as our ability to scale the magic of a close-knit community to thousands, (hopefully soon even millions), of ambitious people. It's more than just a 'cohorts' business; we're building a platform to serve the needs builders of tomorrow. 

If you want to read more about platforms: try this book or this article! 


Why you might be excited about us:

We're tackling a big problem with even bigger potential. We plan to build the modern educational institution for the next 100 years.
Customers f*ng LOVE us. Nearly one in three of our all-time customers (~700 people) have added On Deck to their Twitter bios and/or Linkedin - choosing to align their core professional identity with their participation in an On Deck program. They describe On Deck using superlatives like ""life-changing,"" ""the best decision I ever made,"" ""It's too good to be true, but it's true,"" and more.
You'll be able to work remotely and (mostly) set your own schedule. On Deck was a remote-first team even before COVID, so we know what makes for a great remote environment.
You'll have a lot of flexibility in your role, and will be able to help define what your role and our product-engineering teams looks like going forward.
We're backed by over 200 world-class investors, operators, and executives, including a $20 million Series A led by Keith Rabois at Founders Fund with participation from Village Global, Balaji Srinivasan, Bloomberg Beta, and so many more. (Read more about our Series A in this memo)","Examples of potential work:

How would you empower users to build the best newsfeed for their goals of activity within the On Deck community?
How can you turn fireside chats into knowledge that's served just-in-time to the people working on the topics addressed in a video?
How can you build integrations and/or APIs that both enable the community to build on top of the On Deck ecosystem to serve its needs, while also protecting people's privacy and security?
We hope to help our fellows to find meaning and value in their work and in the relationships they build through it. While this mission is simple, in practice implementation becomes complex as you productizing and scaling human behavior by closely observing the needs of the community. If that sounds exciting to you, we hope you'll join us.","A strong execution-centric full-stack engineer who loves to work on community products
You enjoy building end-to-end features and are comfortable moving across the stack when necessary.
Experience with Node, React, Postgres, GraphQL in mid-to-large sized applications.
Able to lead projects from end to end with technical clarity and confidence.
Able to establish standards in codebases for others to follow.
Detail-oriented, but able to decide what aspects of products need to be perfected and when to cut corners to ship faster.
You thrive in a fast-paced, often scrappy, sometimes chaotic environment.","Targeted Clusters

							",4 month work term,"Come get experience on the ground floor of a local InsurTech startup.  Part of the Accelerator Center business incubator, Only Insurance Inc. (formerly Insurance Squared) is leading the industry in direct online sales of life insurance to consumers.  As a pre-seed venture, we're still in the market testing phase.  That means there's a lot going on and a wide variety of potential tasks.  You'll be working hands-on with the owner on product launches, website setup and maintenance, advertising campaigns, email campaigns, and more. 


The Opportunity:

As a member of our very small team you'll enjoy:
 

A strong co-op learning experience.
Hands on experience in internet marketing from experts in the field.  
Participation in many of our meetings with our Accelerator Center business mentors.
Substantial flexibility in working from home vs working at the Accelerator Center (Evolv1 building - just north of UW campus) alongside other local startups.  
Educational Fridays! Most Fridays we dedicate to learning new skills instead of 'work'.  We'll work with you to develop a roadmap of skills you'd like to learn while here on your co-op.  We'll combine skills that you need immediately for your co-op, with skills for your future that look good on your resume. Previous co-op students have obtained a number of Google and Facebook marketing credentials as well as learning new software for their design skills.  
Where possible, we'll open up other possibilities for you.  For example, our last co-op student had a flair for design, so in addition to their primary internet marketing task, they were provided with complete design control over one of our secondary websites.  They are credited as the designer in the footer of that website. (design skills are not necessary for this placement).

Our Commitment:

We recognise that it's your responsibility to provide a strong work flow to help us move forward.  We also recognise that it's our responsibility to provide training, opportunity for advancement, and new skills that will look great on your resume.","The Job:

As a startup, tasks are flexible and will change. However your core tasks will involve:
 

Managing our various marketing campaigns including Google, Facebook and others.
Administering our websites (wordpress and a variety of plugins).
Participation in the A/B testing and strategy behind design changes in our website. (*)
Monitoring and reporting results of our advertising campaigns, recommending and implementing changes.
As time permits, we'll delve into search engine marketing as well.

(*) This is not a software testing position.  Any software testing will be minor.  Testing refers to A/B or mutlivariate testing of marketing campaigns and landing pages.","Some of our nice-to have skills would be:
 

Business, marketing, or sales experience.
Experience with marketing automation software i.e salesforce or hubspot.
Experience with email drip campaigns.
Internet marketing skills; google adwords or facebook certifications.
Experience with wordpress.
Knowledge of insurance and/or actuarial science.
Experience with small pre-seed startup environments.
Ideally we're looking for a strong self-managed person who's able to independently take our goals, research options and make recommendations, then implement.  

We don't expect you to have any or all of these.  You'll receive on the job training for any of our tools that you will be working with.   


Candidates from any faculty or major are welcome.","Targeted Clusters
