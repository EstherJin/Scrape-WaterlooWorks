							",4 month work term,"Hi, my name is Jane Chae, the Head of Engineering at Versett. I was formerly a co-op student from Waterloo and have worked my way from a developer to a software leader. I've led teams building software solutions from inception to launch.  We are the 'team behind the team' of successful apps, software and platforms around the world with clients like American Express, TD Bank, and Getty Images. Each month, millions of people use the platforms, apps and tools we have built. We have a mission to be the preferred partners of ambitious organizations looking to grow in the modern technology-driven economy.  


Our development team plays a critical role in the definition and delivery of our partner engagements. As our Product Engineer Co-op, you will be solving complex technical problems on client projects working alongside the rest of our Engineering team. Delivering quality code across our technical stack, you will work cross functionally with Product Design led by Dan Rigby and Strategy led by Steven Ritchie to build scalable and reliable solutions positively impacting our client's businesses. 


Our team is tight-knit and built on the philosophy of ""learn better, faster"". Versett was founded on a shared vision of a place where we can create meaningful work collaboratively, while continuing to grow and learn as individuals. 

Versett works globally and we are looking to build our team in Toronto, ON. 


Business Solution Oriented:  

Product Engineers do not stay in a particular lane or application layer. Each engineer helps define and implement end to end functionality with a cross disciplinary team of Product Design led by Dan Rigby and Strategy led by Steven Ritchie.  


We focus on:  

Integration over writing boilerplate (Generic Framework) functionality, which requires core understanding of architectures that support distributed systems. 

Progressive modernization when dealing with revenue-generating systems and legacy software, creating adaptive interfaces to allow slow migration of system capability over time.  

Balancing speed of implementation with longevity of solutions, which is only ensured by having strong alignment on mission and success metrics. 


Consultant first: Every day we strive to help our clients make well informed decisions that benefit their organizations and end users. The Product Engineer prioritizes understanding and articulating the connection of business problems to software solutions.  


This means that each Product Engineer: 

Has the ability and to work independently and within a team environment 

Is a strong team player, collaborator, and mentor to other engineers 

Communicates effectively and works well with a diverse, cross disciplinary team 

Treats every engagement as an opportunity to consult and educate 

Strong design and analytical skills 


THE BEHAVIOURS WE VALUE AT VERSETT:

You're naturally curious, self-motivated, and always looking to learn more. 

You are supportive of others and enjoy sharing knowledge. 

You have a collaborative mindset and have empathy for your users, clients, project team and co-workers.","THE OPPORTUNITY:

Driving the success of our products through strong technical delivery, project delivery, and peer enablement. 

Working alongside Solution Architects and Product Engineers doing tangible client project work, with exposure to clients meetings and discussions. 

Receiving peer mentorship through knowledge sharing. 

Delivering on high-quality code, meeting our code standards with the aim of exceeding them. 

Identifying strategic opportunities in projects for improved delivery.  


Day in the Life:

Attend daily project sprint meetings for status updates and new assignments 

Work with Technical lead to get guidance on assigned tasks 

Learning and investigation of new technologies 

Designing and building new features for web and mobile applications, full stack development  

Write Product Documentation: Functional and technical specifications 

Helping with testing and bug fixing 

DevOps -contribute to build/deployment activities  

Contribute to automation tasks   

Developing Versett's Generic Framework 

Contributor to our Design Council (Engineering council where all engineering design and scope decisions are made","What you bring to the Table:

Focused Generalist: Rather than trying to have as wide of a toolbelt as possible, we try to maintain a focused toolbelt that allows us to solve a lot of common problems. Currently Typescript/Javascript drives our tools of choice, with each team member having or learning foundational competency with deeper focus on one or more subsets of the stack: 

React (Hooks + Context, CSS Modules, Apollo GraphQL)

Our early team is Zach Lloyd (former Google Principal Eng & lead on GDocs), Shikhiu Ing (former UX Lead for GDocs), Aloke Desai (former Senior Eng on GDocs), Michelle Lim (Yale, Neo Scholar), Zheng Tao (Dropbox, Gem, Waterloo grad), Charles Pierce (former Staff Eng at LinkedIn), Agata Cieplik (Dropbox Infrastructure) and Kevin Yang (Minerva, LinkedIn). 


We are looking for engineering interns and co-op students to join us and help bring Warp to the world. 


We recently raised a seed round, and are backed by top-tier investors, as well as notable angels like Marc Benioff and the founders of Figma and Coda. 


Early Traction


You will be joining us during an exciting phase of the company. We recently exited stealth and appeared on the top of HackerNews (twice in the same day!).  Our release video on Twitter was viewed over 125k times and was retweeted by the GitHub CEO.  


We have built a large waitlist and are slowly letting users into the product while getting feedback.  You can join our Discord here if you'd like to check out our current community. 


The Product


The CLI is one of the few tools that all developers use every day, and yet it has seen little innovation in the past 40 years. 


We are reinventing this tool to make it more usable and collaborative, turning it from a low-level utility into a modern product.  Because the terminal is so ubiquitous and so antiquated, there is an opportunity to meaningfully elevate developer productivity across the board. 


The Technology

Our stack is Rust + native graphics on the client, WASM + WebGL in the browser, and Go on the server.  Mac is our first platform, followed by Web, Linux and Windows. 


There are a ton of interesting technical problems to solve:
 

How to build a high-performance Rust GUI app (we have our own UI framework and render directly to the GPU)
How to integrate with existing shells like bash, zsh and fish, while innovating on the CLI
How to build a set of secure cloud services to facilitate collaboration in the CLI

And more… 


The Business Opportunity


We believe there is an opportunity to build a unicorn-sized business improving the command-line. It's one of very few tools used by every developer every day, and its low position in the developer stack makes it an ideal gateway to improve all sorts of developer activities. 


Our strategy is bottom-up developer adoption followed by driving revenue through enterprise sales and distribution partnerships.  Developers are our users; companies are our paying customers. 


To start, we will focus on wide developer adoption, with a goal becoming the everyday terminal of choice.  Warp will be open-source, free to download and install, and immediately usable as a backwards-compatible terminal replacement with the developer's shell of choice. 


Its main value initially will be a better UI plus some hero features like terminal notebooks, infinite history, and real-time collaboration. 


In addition to the open-source terminal client, we will also build a closed-source server, implementing all of the cloud-enabled features. These features will have a freemium model - free for small teams, but paid once you hit a usage or user threshold. 


These features will encourage sharing (e.g. create a notebook and share it with your team), and sharing will drive growth. 


Simultaneously we will focus on building a community and an ecosystem of terminal plugins and apps, creating network effects. 


At higher levels of team penetration we will offer an enterprise plan with features around privacy, security and environment management (e.g. secure distribution and management of API keys). These larger enterprise plans will be the ultimate driver of revenue, along with potential distribution deals for companies that see CLI integrations as a way to reach new customers. 


The ultimate goal is to be one of two main apps that developers use daily (along with the code editor). If we can achieve that goal, we are confident in building a huge business. 


Our Culture


We are a company run by developers, building a core product for all developers.   


We are committed to understanding our users deeply. We believe we will ultimately build the best product and business if that team includes developers from a wide range of backgrounds. 


We value honesty, humility, and pragmatism, and our core product principle is focusing on the user. 


To get more of a feel for what our company values on the engineering side, please take a look at our internal How We Work guide and Zach's blog, https://thezbook.com/. 


Company Info


We are based in NYC and SF, but we are location agnostic, as we are building a distributed company.  We have a small opt-in office in NYC. 


We are currently a team of 8: Zach, Shikhiu, Aloke, Michelle, Zheng, Charles, Agata and Kevin.","If you join us, you'll have the opportunity to: 

* Work on a product that all developers use every day 

* Do meaningful engineering work - we are looking for real contributions from our interns 

* Learn professional software development and be mentored from an experienced team 

* Be exposed to other aspects of startups, such as product development, project management, customer development. 

* Tackle challenging technical problems - one of the main reasons there has been little innovation in this space is that for historical reasons the terminal / shell division makes it hard to innovate 

* Work on a fast moving project right from day one 


You will essentially function as a junior engineer on the team, and, as such, need to be able to write and ship production code.","Candidates should have completed their first two years of CS education by their start date. 


The ideal intern candidate: 

* Is passionate about helping developers get more done - would jump at the chance to work on this particular product 

* Has amazing engineering chops but also product and user focused 

* Great communication and collaboration skills 

* Plus: has experience with any of the following: 

** building open-source software  

** shell / linux-programming 

** openGL/webGL 

** building native apps in Rust / WASM 

These are just nice-to-haves. We are a community of curious learners, and most of us are learning these for the very first time!","Targeted Clusters

For 22 years, WA operated a Flagship store in the Manulife Centre at 55 Bloor St W in Toronto before moving in 2019 to the luxuriously renovated Flagship store in The Colonnade, 131 Bloor St W. 

  

WA is also famous for its hugely successful in-person William Ashley Warehouse Sale, held in the Spring/Summer and Fall. The Fall of 2021 will mark the 46th continuous year of the Sale, Covid permitting.

The role is an entry-level role. You'll work directly with a mentor engineer who will help spec out problems, guide your solutions, and give you code review comments helping to build better software. 


A little bit about us: Wrk is about dramatically simplifying automation. We're building a world where any process can be replicated by combining human skill sets and bots into pre-configured units of work that we call 'Wrk Actions'. We don't believe automation should be scary, complicated, or confusing to deploy. If you're excited about a journey where we can reinvent work together, where a hybrid human + machine delivers more, better, and faster than either alone, then come work with us. 

We are a team of highly experienced entrepreneurs, engineers, sales and marketing executives who have gone through the process of building, growing, scaling, and selling a business. Now, we're doing it all over again. We're looking to add like-minded individuals to our team as we embark on a journey to build a game-changing company, and take it public. The company was founded in 2019, has received funding from prominent venture capital and angel investors, and has a strong product-market fit with paying clients. 


We are a fully distributed company, the engineering team is spread all over the continent from Vancouver to Tampa - you could work from the beach in California or from a ski lodge in Whistler, up to you. We have a great mix of people in the team including junior engineers right out of school to people with 20+ years in industry, coming from all sorts of companies including Google, Amazon, NVIDIA, and loads of other startups. We take extra steps to make remote work fun, including small team happy hours, demo days, and online games.","As a software developer on this product, your responsibilities are to: 

* Build features and fix bugs to help improve our product. 

* Provide feedback on the code and designs of your fellow teammates. 

* Write unit tests, learn style guidelines, and integrate with our continuous-delivery systems to ensure rock-solid code that can handle the weirdness of reality.","For all teams: 

* Software design patterns, OOP concepts, data structures. 

* Knowledge of internet protocols, most importantly HTTP. 

* Ability to communicate online: video chat, screen-share, text-based chat, email. 

* Nice to have: familiarity with UNIX toolchains: git, Linux, command-line. 

* Nice to have: familiarity with distributed systems, microservices, docker 


For front-end projects: 

* Experience with Javascript, CSS, HTML 

* Nice to have: experience with component-based frameworks like React or LitElement 

* Nice to have: experience with TypeScript

The Wysdom platform is built on a state-of-the-art NLP infrastructure, complemented with the tools, data and people to ensure successful operation of the suite of Wysdom products. 


Wysdom has analyzed millions of customer inquiries over the years, providing an extremely smart solution that only gets smarter with each question asked.  A core set of front-end artificial intelligence tools, and backend cognitive data management tools, coupled with our team of AI optimization experts, make up the framework of our solution. Our clients include large communications companies, banks, and insurance companies in Canada and around the world.","So what is a Wysdom Cognitive Data Analyst?


Behind every amazing AI-based solution is a team of really smart, passionate people. This is your chance to join this team as a Cognitive Data Analyst. With a passion for helping our clients deliver an amazing customer experience, your core role will be to train the Wysdom AI solution. Sound too techie for you? Don't worry - what we need is your analytical mind and strong communication skills. This is not a computer science role! We already have the tools to make this happen. 

  

As a Cognitive Data Analyst, you will have the opportunity to get familiar and work with the life cycle of conversational bots. You will work on building chat bots, testing those bots and evaluating their performance. AI is the future and you will be on the front lines. 

  

Our clients are some of the top brands in the world. You will get a chance to not only see, but be a part of, how these companies are transforming their customer care operations into world-class digital experiences. Because let's face it - when was the last time you looked forward to sitting on hold waiting for a customer service rep to explain why your bill was so high last month? You want to find your own answer, on your own time - and that's what Wysdom does for our clients. 


Cool. But what will I actually be doing?

  

The day-to-day role will involve reviewing customer questions that our solution didn't answer - and determining why and what to do about it. You will review the customer feedback on answers we delivered to help our clients continually improve the responses that we deploy to their customers. 


Identifying why the answers and articles may not have been satisfactory, making recommendations and creating or updating customer communications will be a great opportunity for you to learn more about customer communications and hone your writing skills. 

  

Typical day-to-day responsibilities may include:

Create, review and edit Wysdom's customer facing information to ensure customers can easily understand and take action on the content
Maintain the quality and style of communications from Wysdom across all end users
Work with our clients to align with brand and style guidelines
Create write training and support materials

Oh, and did we mention that we also power the Facebook Messenger and other chatbot customer care solutions that our clients use? Now this could be fun!","I'm in - but what do you need from me?

With the explosion of information and data online, search has never been more important. However, while the world of consumer search has innovated over time, enterprise search has not. In fact, the majority of enterprise search is powered by outdated keyword technology that only scans for keywords and delivers a list of hyperlinks rather than actually answering questions. Yext, the AI Search Company, offers a modern, AI-powered Answers Platform that understands natural language so that when people ask questions about a business online they get direct answers ? not links.

We have a big, audacious mission to transform the enterprise with AI search. To achieve that, we need bright minds and diverse perspectives to join our growing company and help us continue to disrupt an industry. Does this sound like you?

Yext's mission is to provide perfect answers everywhere. It starts with a customer's own website: Yext's Answers product replaces unhelpful site searches with NLP-powered, dynamic result content.  When you look for answers about a business anywhere else on the web, whether through Google, Alexa, Yelp, Facebook, Apple, Instagram, Snapchat, or even Baidu and WeChat in China, you are getting brand verified answers sourced directly from that business.

We're looking for Software Engineers to join the Yext Engineering team and drive the technology behind our revolutionary product offering! Our team works in an agile environment running two-week sprints that culminate with demos of features in progress. You will work alongside engineers from the top universities and tech companies in the world, hands-on with the code from day one.","Participate in full life-cycle software development

A little bit about us: Wrk is about dramatically simplifying automation. We're building a world where any process can be replicated by combining human skill sets and bots into pre-configured units of work that we call 'Wrk Actions'. We don't believe automation should be scary, complicated, or confusing to deploy. If you're excited about a journey where we can reinvent work together, where a hybrid human + machine delivers more, better, and faster than either alone, then come work with us.

Now, we're doing it all over again. We're looking to add like-minded individuals to our team as we embark on a journey to build a game-changing company, and take it public. The company was founded in 2019, has received funding from prominent venture capital and angel investors, and has a strong product-market fit with paying clients. 


We are a fully distributed company, the engineering team is spread all over the continent from Vancouver to Tampa - you could work from the beach in California or from a ski lodge in Whistler, up to you. We have a great mix of people in the team including junior engineers right out of school to people with 20+ years in industry, coming from all sorts of companies including Google, Amazon, NVIDIA, and loads of other startups.

We do all the work for enterprises as their business evolves, from set-up to optimization.  Our customer's only job is to tell us what matters to their customers and what matters to them.  We'll take it from there, while providing the ongoing insights on how Wysdom is shaping the experience of the enterprise's customers.  


The Wysdom platform is built on a state-of-the-art NLP infrastructure, complemented with the tools, data and people to ensure successful operation of the suite of Wysdom products. 


Wysdom has analyzed millions of customer inquiries over the years, providing an extremely smart solution that only gets smarter with each question asked.  A core set of front-end artificial intelligence tools, and backend cognitive data management tools, coupled with our team of AI optimization experts, make up the framework of our solution. Our clients include large communications companies, banks, and insurance companies in Canada and around the world.","So what is a Wysdom Cognitive Data Analyst?


Behind every amazing AI-based solution is a team of really smart, passionate people. This is your chance to join this team as a Cognitive Data Analyst. With a passion for helping our clients deliver an amazing customer experience, your core role will be to train the Wysdom AI solution. Sound too techie for you? Don't worry - what we need is your analytical mind and strong communication skills. This is not a computer science role! We already have the tools to make this happen. 

  

As a Cognitive Data Analyst, you will have the opportunity to get familiar and work with the life cycle of conversational bots. You will work on building chat bots, testing those bots and evaluating their performance. AI is the future and you will be on the front lines. 

  

Our clients are some of the top brands in the world. You will get a chance to not only see, but be a part of, how these companies are transforming their customer care operations into world-class digital experiences. Because let's face it - when was the last time you looked forward to sitting on hold waiting for a customer service rep to explain why your bill was so high last month? You want to find your own answer, on your own time - and that's what Wysdom does for our clients. 


Cool. But what will I actually be doing?

  

The day-to-day role will involve reviewing customer questions that our solution didn't answer - and determining why and what to do about it. You will review the customer feedback on answers we delivered to help our clients continually improve the responses that we deploy to their customers. 


Identifying why the answers and articles may not have been satisfactory, making recommendations and creating or updating customer communications will be a great opportunity for you to learn more about customer communications and hone your writing skills. 

  

Typical day-to-day responsibilities may include:

Create, review and edit Wysdom's customer facing information to ensure customers can easily understand and take action on the content
Maintain the quality and style of communications from Wysdom across all end users
Work with our clients to align with brand and style guidelines
Create write training and support materials

Oh, and did we mention that we also power the Facebook Messenger and other chatbot customer care solutions that our clients use? Now this could be fun!","I'm in - but what do you need from me?

With the explosion of information and data online, search has never been more important. However, while the world of consumer search has innovated over time, enterprise search has not. In fact, the majority of enterprise search is powered by outdated keyword technology that only scans for keywords and delivers a list of hyperlinks rather than actually answering questions. Yext, the AI Search Company, offers a modern, AI-powered Answers Platform that understands natural language so that when people ask questions about a business online they get direct answers ? not links.

We have a big, audacious mission to transform the enterprise with AI search. To achieve that, we need bright minds and diverse perspectives to join our growing company and help us continue to disrupt an industry. Does this sound like you?

Yext's mission is to provide perfect answers everywhere. It starts with a customer's own website: Yext's Answers product replaces unhelpful site searches with NLP-powered, dynamic result content.  When you look for answers about a business anywhere else on the web, whether through Google, Alexa, Yelp, Facebook, Apple, Instagram, Snapchat, or even Baidu and WeChat in China, you are getting brand verified answers sourced directly from that business.

We're looking for Software Engineers to join the Yext Engineering team and drive the technology behind our revolutionary product offering! Our team works in an agile environment running two-week sprints that culminate with demos of features in progress. You will work alongside engineers from the top universities and tech companies in the world, hands-on with the code from day one.","Participate in full life-cycle software development

OUR TEAMS
 
Zynga's software engineers don't just develop some of the world's largest games, they deliver highly scalable infrastructure used by tens of millions of users every day. Our software engineers are blazing trails in all facets of game design, mobile technologies, and massive scalability. Zynga faces a number of challenges - but many are unique to our situation: the large data requirements of online gaming require us to continually push boundaries to discover the best solutions. Zynga software engineers are willing to pick up any of the languages, technologies, or methodologies necessary to smite a challenge - and if a conventional solution doesn't exist, they innovate as necessary. Our software engineers are comfortable moving between front end, back end, and architecture roles.","You will be considered for software engineering opportunities in Zynga's Analytics teams in the Toronto office. Here are some of the areas we're currently considering candidates for:
 
Application Platform Engineering: 
Our team builds systems and solutions for experimentation/optimization, business intelligence, user acquisition and various other analytics applications. The experimentation and optimization systems are used by game teams to conduct A/B testing, ramping up features, and optimize various aspects of social gaming. The business intelligence systems enable game teams to discover and gather players insights to make data-driven decisions. We also work closely with the UA managers to create solutions to streamline, automate, and optimize the user acquisition workflow. In addition to the core products mentioned above, we also collaborate with our analysts and data scientists to build new applications and platforms in Analytics. Our systems are built using a variety of tech stacks, including AngularJS, React, Node.js, Java (Spring), Python, Kubernetes, Docker, and various AWS technologies.
 
 
ML Engineering: 
Zynga's ML Engineering team applies cutting edge AI/ML to improve Zynga's games. We combine backend development, data engineering and data science. We develop production ML workflows with Spark, Python and Tensorflow. We also own high scale backend ML services written in Go. Our focus for AI is using Deep Reinforcement Learning to personalize our games, eg. using a player's history to decide what level to show next or how difficult to make a challenge. As industry leaders in the field, we've developed an open source library called RL Bakery and spoke at this year's Spark Summit. Our coops work on a variety of projects such as integrating new algorithms into our libraries, developing data pipelines, tuning AI models and adding features to our ML infrastructure.

Behind every amazing AI-based solution is a team of really smart, passionate people. This is your chance to join this team as a Cognitive Data Analyst. With a passion for helping our clients deliver an amazing customer experience, your core role will be to train the Wysdom AI solution. Sound too techie for you? Don't worry - what we need is your analytical mind and strong communication skills. This is not a computer science role! We already have the tools to make this happen. 

  

As a Cognitive Data Analyst, you will have the opportunity to get familiar and work with the life cycle of conversational bots. You will work on building chat bots, testing those bots and evaluating their performance. AI is the future and you will be on the front lines. 

  

Our clients are some of the top brands in the world. You will get a chance to not only see, but be a part of, how these companies are transforming their customer care operations into world-class digital experiences. Because let's face it - when was the last time you looked forward to sitting on hold waiting for a customer service rep to explain why your bill was so high last month? You want to find your own answer, on your own time - and that's what Wysdom does for our clients. 


Cool. But what will I actually be doing?

  

The day-to-day role will involve reviewing customer questions that our solution didn't answer - and determining why and what to do about it. You will review the customer feedback on answers we delivered to help our clients continually improve the responses that we deploy to their customers. 


Identifying why the answers and articles may not have been satisfactory, making recommendations and creating or updating customer communications will be a great opportunity for you to learn more about customer communications and hone your writing skills. 

  

Typical day-to-day responsibilities may include:

Create, review and edit Wysdom's customer facing information to ensure customers can easily understand and take action on the content
Maintain the quality and style of communications from Wysdom across all end users
Work with our clients to align with brand and style guidelines
Create write training and support materials

Oh, and did we mention that we also power the Facebook Messenger and other chatbot customer care solutions that our clients use? Now this could be fun!","I'm in - but what do you need from me?

Strong writing and communications skills
Effective time management skills
""All hands on deck"" mentality
Passion for delivering amazing results

With the explosion of information and data online, search has never been more important. However, while the world of consumer search has innovated over time, enterprise search has not. In fact, the majority of enterprise search is powered by outdated keyword technology that only scans for keywords and delivers a list of hyperlinks rather than actually answering questions. Yext, the AI Search Company, offers a modern, AI-powered Answers Platform that understands natural language so that when people ask questions about a business online they get direct answers ? not links.

We have a big, audacious mission to transform the enterprise with AI search. To achieve that, we need bright minds and diverse perspectives to join our growing company and help us continue to disrupt an industry. Does this sound like you?

Yext's mission is to provide perfect answers everywhere. It starts with a customer's own website: Yext's Answers product replaces unhelpful site searches with NLP-powered, dynamic result content.  When you look for answers about a business anywhere else on the web, whether through Google, Alexa, Yelp, Facebook, Apple, Instagram, Snapchat, or even Baidu and WeChat in China, you are getting brand verified answers sourced directly from that business.

We're looking for Software Engineers to join the Yext Engineering team and drive the technology behind our revolutionary product offering! Our team works in an agile environment running two-week sprints that culminate with demos of features in progress. You will work alongside engineers from the top universities and tech companies in the world, hands-on with the code from day one.","Participate in full life-cycle software development
