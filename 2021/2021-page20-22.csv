							",4 month work term,"Update fundamental cross section calculations in the EGSnrc software

  

Within the Ionizing Radiation Standards Group at the National Research Council of Canada, a team is dedicated to the Monte Carlo simulation of radiation transport using the renowned open source software EGSnrc (github.com/nrc-cnrc/EGSnrc). This software was created and developed by this group over nearly 40 years and is used worldwide to model the passage of electrons and photons through materials, in particular in the field of medical physics for research in medical imaging and radiation therapy. 

  

One key feature of EGSnrc is the ability to model material composition and density accurately. Regions of various materials in the simulation are each represented as homogenous volumes? (optionally with molecular form factors). For the purpose of a transport simulation, a material is wholly specified by its cross sections, which in turn depend on atomic composition, density, and mean ionization energy (the I-value). However the rate of energy loss of an ionizing electron in dense media is famously less than expected from single-atom scattering theory, due to the density effect arising from the dielectric polarization of the media. Hence simulations incorporate density effect corrections, in the form of data tables which have been generated manually with the ESTAR software from NIST (physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/Star/Text/ESTAR.html). This process is cumbersome and error-prone, undermining confidence in reference dosimetry simulations. 

  

There are two main objectives in this project: 1) integrate a density effect correction code into EGSnrc, so that it is calculated on-the-fly from material parameters, instead of relying on data tables generated by users; and 2) validate the existing density effect correction calculation and material data files distributed with EGSnrc, especially in view of the latest recommendations by the International Commission on Radiation Units (ICRU Report 90). This project will involve implementing the density effect correction calculations into C++ (using the venerable Fortran ESTAR code as a baseline), while getting trained in fundamental aspects of ionizing radiation travelling in materials and Monte Carlo simulation methods. 

  

Specifically, the following project steps are envisaged


 
 

Understand the physics of density effect corrections, and its implementation in ESTAR
Implement a C++ version of density effect correction calculations
Integrate the new C++ ESTAR code inside the EGSnrc initialization routines
Review existing EGSnrc density effect correction files and material data

  

This work involves a strong computational flavour, with a software development environment geared for the GNU/Linux operating system. At the end of the work term the student will be confident in running advanced EGSnrc radiation transport simulations involving practically any material. EGSnrc development is done publicly on github, hence the student can easily showcase code contributions to prospective employers. The student will be under the functional supervision of Dr Reid Townson within the Medical and Industrial Dosimetry team, but will work as part of the IRS team responsible for Monte Carlo simulations and the development of the EGSnrc software.","The project would be suited to either a physics undergrad with a leaning towards coding or a computer science student with an interest in physics!

Our BMS has been used to electrify RVs, planes, and ships. It's been used to power EV charging stations, buildings, and islands. 


In addition to offering a superior BMS, our engineering team provides a range of energy storage system development services, including energy management system (EMS) algorithms, remote and on-site system integration support for our battery management systems. 

You will be working on the system software that includes:
 

Real-time execution over multiple processors
Control and data aggregation of multiple battery energy storage systems (BESS)
Interfacing with third party controllers/equipment and adhering to industry standards (SunSpec Energy Storage Model)
Modelling, simulation, implementation and verification of advanced algorithms

Who is Nuvation Energy?

At Nuvation, we are engineers to the core - it is our culture and we engage in it as a team sport.  We enjoy gnarly challenges and see creative opportunities, where others see problems. We specialize in the ridiculous and emphatically reject the limitations of conventional wisdom. 

We are huge proponents of 'dogfooding' - i.e. using what we build. In our spare-time we stop engineering for fun and money, and start engineering for fun alone. We built e-Rex (an electric car), BESSIE (an EV charging station), a Robot Bartender, and other arguably useful inventions that require an incredible amount of engineering expertise to make them work! 

We are fanatical pragmatists who revere logic, process, repeatability, and methodology. You will be working with highly competent team members who are wired to respond to challenges with innovation. We're very comfortable skating on the bleeding-edge of technology. 

Our business fuels our culture, and our culture fuels our business. We love the work that we do and enjoy working with each other every day. 

  

If this sounds like an environment where you can thrive, come join us!","Who do we hire?

Students who understand our guiding principles: skilled, passionate and personal individuals who are looking for a real challenging coop term. It is not just technical skills you'll need - we also highly value communications, passion, cooperation, independence, professionalism, creativity, and self-motivation. The ideal candidate has demonstrated experience working with multi-discipline teams, has sound knowledge of software engineering practices, and is comfortable in a highly collaborative environment. There is an opportunity to take ownership and guide the maturing product to new areas of deployment. If you are looking for constant challenges on a wide variety of design problems, this is the job for you. 


What do we look for in the interview process? 

Nuvation interviews with three main factors being evaluated - your knowledge (experience), your aptitude (ability to learn), and your personality (ability to communicate, personal interactions, and non-engineering experience). We are looking for the right people for our team, not the best match for a series of checkboxes. 

The following are examples of relevant experience for the python software design position:
 

Python development experience
Device interfacing experience using protocols such as Modbus, CAN, and DNP
Open source library experience such as Redis, PostgreSQL, Timescale DB
Advanced algorithms research, simulation, implementation and validation
Familiarity with a Continuous Integration (CI) process and test development.
Experience with developing and using specifications and requirements which are based on technical needs
Experience writing well-designed, efficient and testable code by using established software development practices
Experience with structured software development methodologies such as Agile


Working knowledge of modern web techniques and technologies like ES6 JavaScript, Typescript, AJAX, REST, and JSON
Experience with web server technologies like Java and Node.js, and Linux-based web servers like NGINX
Experience working with stakeholders and customers to determine technical requirements and engineering implementation needs
Experience with encryption, security and authentication
Design experience in a complementary discipline","The right kind of person for a coop job at Nuvation is dedicated, self-motivated, and eager to take on responsibility. We look for at least two solid terms in a professional engineering environment, with experience in some of the areas noted previously. Nuvation does occasionally hire students from outside this targeted experience, and if you think you've got what it takes without the typical experience, be sure to passionately communicate that in your cover letter. 


What type of work does Nuvation assign to Coops?

Nuvation does design work in three main areas: Hardware, Firmware/Software, and Logic. The more you know in each of these areas, the easier it will be for you to work in interdisciplinary roles, and the more advanced projects you can become involved in from the start. Teams at Nuvation vary from one to a dozen engineers, with most projects in the range of two to five engineers. Nuvation engineers are often interacting directly with customers, and are all working in a highly collaborative environment. Our environment not only develops your technical skills, but also your 'soft' skills - communication, teamwork, and personal interactions. Coop students at Nuvation are immediately brought into the engineering environment as a full contributor and are asked to jump right into their work. You can expect more action in your first day or two than you'll see in weeks at other employers. The following areas are examples of software that you may be assigned to work on:
 

Adding new features to our EMS software driven by customer needs and requirements
Advancing the design of our EMS software using Python 3 capabilities
Extending our algorithms and simulation capabilities","Targeted Clusters
