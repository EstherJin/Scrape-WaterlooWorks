This includes many historical and scientifically significant fossils from the Canadian Arctic. The Museum serves the research and education needs of a broad community by building, preserving, upgrading, and facilitating access to the collection, providing staff with exciting opportunities to play a role in current nature research and collection management. 

The CMN has received funding from The Mosaic Company for the inventory and cataloguing of recently repatriated vertebrate fossils that were collected from the Silurian and Devonian rocks of the Canadian Arctic. This important acquisition consists of a thousand (or more) uncatalogued fossil fishes collected in the 60's and 70's by a British crew. Many of these specimens belong to a diverse, extinct group of jawless and armoured fish called heterostracans, but the material includes representatives of several other groups as well. The specimens await being systematically identified, catalogued, and digitized so that the data may be made publicly accessible online for learning and decision-making, adding to a growing resource that serves scientists, students, land managers, and nature enthusiasts worldwide. 

To accomplish this work, the CMN is looking for one co-op intern to undertake the task of accessioning these repatriated fossil specimens.

								Sep 21, 2021
								
							",4 month work term,"Company Profile

At Christie Digital Systems, we specialize in world class projection and illumination devices. Our technology is used to projection map on everything from sports arenas to theme parks, buildings, statues and various world class attractions. We can turn any surface in to a canvas painted with light. 


Some Christie projection mapping projects are highlighted in this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7CBEC9E4CFDB1FD9


Large location-based entertainment often requires the use of multi-projector blended displays, with each projector warping video content to the projection surface and blending away overlap zones. This results in a smooth, seamless display of light on any surface you can imagine. 


In the Software Solutions Development Team, we strive to improve the audience experience through mapping and calibration techniques by developing our flagship product, Mystique: https://www.christiedigital.com/products/warping-blending/mystique/ 


Mystique is an extremely powerful tool capable of computing the geometric and illumination relationships within a projector-camera system. It is also capable of pushing warps and blends to our projectors and media servers. 


Our team works collaboratively with other teams at Christie, including the Advanced Research and Collaboration (ARC) team to integrate new methods and technologies into our products. We consider our co-op positions to be equal to full-time developers, with equal expectations and responsibilities. We always help to bridge the knowledge gaps with dedicated mentorship and coaching. Co-ops have always amazed us with their contributions.

Employees in the D2L Toronto office enjoy a variety of perks like the foosball table, free snacks, games in the office (board games and video games), and an open concept office that makes it easy for you to interact and learn from people across the company. The Toronto Social Committee runs events regularly that give everyone a chance to get out of the office and/or away from their work and have some fun. 


The office is located in the King West area of downtown Toronto at the corner of King and Spadina - it is an amazing spot that is close to many venues/attractions. The tech community is very active in the area with regular (usually monthly) meetups for multiple different groups giving you an opportunity to connect with others and usually enjoy some free food if you get there early. Speaking of food, there are dozens of truly excellent restaurants  within walking distance - you will miss this when you go back to school. On top of all that, there is also the fact that Toronto is the home to sports team in most/all major leagues, has great museums and cultural attractions, attracts the best shows in music and theatre, and is one of the best cities in the world. 


Plus, when you graduate and are looking for a place where you can make a difference by changing the way the world learns, think about D2L and the step ahead of the rest you would be by networking within D2L on your work term.","What you will get out of working for D2L Labs?

										Game Programmer
									


",Eden Industries,Divisional Office,5,Open for Applications,Maple Ridge,"Intermediate, Senior",3,"
								Sep 21, 2021
								
							",4 month work term,"Do you love videogames? Have you been dreaming about making them since you were a kid? If the answer to both of those questions is yes, this is the job for you! 


Eden Industries is a small videogame development company based in Vancouver that is passionately developing games primarily for the PC and console markets. We're just about to ship Toy Soldiers: HD (published by Accelerate Games for PC/Switch/PS4/Xbox One) and we have a few new projects in development currently. Our other previous games include: 


-Citizens Unite! Earth x Space (published by KEMCO for PC/Switch/PS4) 

-Citizens of Space (published by SEGA for PC/PS4/Switch/XBox One) 

-Citizens of Earth (published by Atlus for PC/Wii U/PS4/3DS/Vita) 

-Waveform (four-time nominee at the Canadian Videogame Awards, released for Steam/iOS/Android). 


We have a number of games in development at the moment, including an announced one - Extinction Wars, which is a strategy game that's a bit of a mix of StarCraft and Advance Wars and super awesome! Check it out here: https://www.outerheavenstudios.com/blank-page 


We were also featured in an interview with Waterloo's Co-op Department to talk about what it's like making videogames, check it out! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quRyLDibyfw 


C++ programming will constitute the bulk of the job, although game design opportunities are also possible for candidates interested in them. Since the team is small, the company culture and development style is very fast-paced, dynamic, and fluid. As a result, the successful candidate will be able to participate in a wide range of development possibilities dependant on the individual skills and interests of the successful candidate and may include such areas as: 

-Gameplay programming. Make characters move, perform actions, AI and state-machine work, etc. 

-UI programming. Menus for information, options, etc. 

-Tools programming. A lot of great pipeline code that supports making great games! There may be a bit of C# and/or Javascript involved here too, if relevant to the candidate. 

-Engine programming. We have our own in-house game engine that we've been developing for over a decade now. Any work in this area will involve the addition or improvement of core systems that support the games we make, but in a game-independent way. If you love low-level systems (memory management, audio processing, rendering, etc.) or are a mastermind of system architecture, there'll be some fun work here for you! 


This position is intended to be performed remotely - the company is comprised of a decentralized group of developers across Canada and the world. Since the majority are located in the Greater Vancouver Area, however, if you happen to be nearby there will be opportunities to meet up for coworking and fun! As a result of the remote nature of the work, it is of paramount importance that candidates possess an outstanding work ethic and are extremely self-motivated. Although the successful candidate will be in constant communication with the rest of the team through a variety of methods (Slack, email, the project tracking server, etc.) there won't be anyone looking over your shoulder while you work.  


As a developer in a small team, you have the opportunity to make a significant impact on the games in development and leave your mark on games that you can be proud of when you show them to your friends and family. Whether that's in designing a new feature and implementing it that you can later play, devising a brilliant new tool to help the artists do their job faster and better (a fact they'll love you for, even if you don't get to directly play that in the final game), or anything in between! You won't just be a cog in a coding machine for this position - you'll be an essential part of bringing awesome new videogames to the world! 


Making videogames is a lot of fun, but it's also a lot of hard work. Especially with the time limitation of the co-op term, you'll have to learn fast and code fast.","You will primarily be responsible for programming new features in C++ for a variety of areas of game development. You will also be responsible for thoroughly testing any features that you develop and fixing any bugs. 


Since the position is remote, you will be responsible for managing your time effectively and efficiently.  


From time to time you may also be required to speak with artists, sound designers, level designers, and other non-technical staff in the development of tools to assist them in their work or in hooking up their assets into the game.","Super Important: 

-Experience with C++ is absolutely essential. You don't need to be a master of the more esoteric features of C++, but pointers and dynamic memory allocation/deallocation shouldn't cause you to bat an eye. 

-Passionate love of videogames. 

-Strong work ethic and self-motivation.  

-Experience with C++. Yes it was the first one listed, but it's also the last. Because it's that important! 


Essential: 

-Experience working in a large codebase 

-Good communication and teamworking skills. Although this one should almost go without saying, it's very important given the remote nature of the position.  


Great to have: 

-Strong mathematical foundation (linear algebra, polar coordinates, etc.) 

-Experience with source control systems (bonus for SVN or Git) 

-Experience working in, and especially debugging through, Visual Studio 

-Experience with game development 

-Experience with C# and/or Javascript 

-Creative. Whether that's in thinking of outside-the-box systems to develop or new game design possibilities to implement.","Targeted Clusters

We are currently located in the awesome Communitech building in downtown Kitchener-Waterloo. The team is working from home for the time being, but we are excited to get back when the time is right.","What you'll do


As a member of the bill analysis and code breaking team at EnPowered your work will include a mix of complex problem solving, operations, and strategy. 


Problem Solving:

The majority of your time will be spent trying to reverse engineer electricity bills; you will know the end result (the bill total), and most of the inputs (usage, rates, etc.), but you will need to figure out the combination of inputs that deliver the correct output
This may seem simple, unfortunately the electricity industry loves their exceptions, and so you will often need to find exactly how a utility is calculating a customers' bill in order to accurately reverse engineer it
This is currently done within a complex excel file, but as soon as a subset of customers' bills have reliably been reverse engineered to 99.99% accuracy the product team will automate the process


Operations:

Clearly explain to the product team how to automate the reverse engineering of electricity bills after you have successfully decrypted them
Leverage your knowledge of how bills work to support the sales enablement and customer success teams in answering customer questions about billing


Strategy:

Find unique savings opportunities and billing errors that can be leveraged as new solutions for our customers
Work with other teams to help develop strategies to roll-out automated features faster in new markets and utility jurisdictions","Who you are

You love to solve problems and riddles; the kind of person who solves Sudoku puzzles to relax, has excel files to track everything, or plays video games with lots of numbers and graphs
You are someone who wants to own their work; when you start you will have a list of to dos, but within 3 months you are expected to be largely independent and capable of prioritizing your own list of tasks
You should be comfortable working in a fast-paced startup environment and taking on tasks that may not fit your job description
You have the proven ability to start and run your own projects from beginning to end
You have very strong written and verbal communication skills and the ability to collaborate across teams
You have very advanced Excel skills, including strong knowledge of managing large files, manipulating Pivot Tables, and using Index functions

The Canadian Ice Service (CIS), Environment and Climate Change Canada, is responsible for monitoring and providing timely and accurate information on sea ice and iceberg conditions in Canadian waters, as well as maintaining the climate records for sea ice. We rely primarily on the visual interpretation of radar (SAR) satellite imagery, namely the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) and Sentinel-1. We are one of the largest Government of Canada users of SAR data, with near-complete daily or weekly coverage of our areas of interest, ingesting and analysing upward of 400 SAR images every day. 


To learn more about our work, visit us on Twitter @ECCC_CIS. Did you know that CIS has hired Waterloo co-op students since the 1980's, and that our current manager of Applied Science started at CIS as a co-op student? 

  

We are looking for two co-op students to join our Applied Science and Development section to work on developing an initial capability in deep learning, to support the automation of two ice-monitoring workflows (details below), leveraging existing code and concepts elaborated by our partners in recent years. The two students will work closely with three other Physical Sciences Specialists who are experts in satellite image interpretation and processing, as well as project advisors from our IT and Operations groups. 


Specifically, we are looking for someone studying: 

  

- Computer science with an interest in geography, geomatics, or image processing, OR; 

- Geomatics with a strong computer science foundation interested in programming, OR; 

- Mathematics, engineering, or physics with a strong interest in programming.","Project

The students and CIS staff will work closely as an integrated project team to propose and implement a proof-of-concept system for automating two important ice-monitoring workflows using deep learning. We will train multi-scale U-Net deep learning models and establish the data connections and pre-processing pipelines for RCM and Sentinel-1 satellite imagery as the main input to estimate two parameters:
 

Lake Ice cover (percentage) as part of CIS's Inland Lakes monitoring program (about 300 lakes, monitored weekly), and
sea ice cover (percentage) and sea ice edge as part of Canada's METAREA responsibilities (daily bulletins).

This project will require knowledge of Python, Git, and libraries such as GDAL, Keras and TensorFlow.

The co-op student will be responsible for the analysis of a novel dataset of lidar observations from multiple ceilometer and Doppler lidar instruments deployed across Canada to investigate the evolution of the atmospheric boundary layer height and winds. Existing scientific analysis codes, written in python, are to be expanded upon and new ones are to be created in order to analyze the lidars' observational datasets and generate results (plots). The ultimate goal of this research project is to develop a robust boundary layer detection algorithm, generate plots, and prepare scientific procedures and algorithms for upcoming field campaigns, with the possibility of publication in a scientific journal.","Applicant Requirements

							",4 month work term,"The Meteorological Research Division of Environment and Climate Change Canada conducts research in weather analysis and forecasting, thus equipping Canadians to make informed decisions on weather conditions. Freezing rain weather events can have large impact on society (increased number of slip and fall injuries, disruption to transportation, damage to power grid), yet they remain challenging to forecast accurately. Moreover, even the simple distinction between rain and snow can have very different impacts for both hydrology (spring snow melt, rain-on-snow events), meteorological weather warnings (snow storms and blowing snow) and climate change (snow albedo feedback). Within the Observation-Based Research Section, new methods for the inference of the precipitation type (rain, snow, freezing rain, ice pellets, etc.) using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are being investigated. 


The work term project will consist in determining the feasibility of using lidar technology for nowcasting precipitation type using machine/deep learning methods. 


Lidars provide observations of water vapour and temperature at high frequency/low latency which makes them excellent candidates for nowcasting applications (that is, forecasting with a lead time of a few hours). Testing the machine/deep learning algorithms on the lidar observations will help us conclude the feasibility of using lidar observations to predict precipitation type. If successful, this would illustrate one benefit of using lidars in a larger meteorological network. 


It is expected that the work could eventually lead to a scientific publication as well as actual improvements on precipitation type forecasts for all Canadians.","- Import, ingest and visualize meteorological data sources (e.g. lidar observations, gridded forecasts, weather station observations, airport reports)

Description of work undertaken by divisions within the Economic Analysis Directorate:

  

Current Analysis and Economic Research Division


The Current Analysis and Economic Research Division undertakes major research projects with important environmental policy relevance, such as Canada's Mid-Century Strategy. It develops metrics such as the Social Cost of Carbon, and develops assessments of the upstream greenhouse gas emissions associated with major energy and infrastructure projects. The division leads the department's work on files like fossil fuel subsidy reform and sustainable finance, including climate-related financial risk disclosure. The division also analyzes the competitiveness impacts of proposed environmental policies, such as regulations and carbon pricing.  


  

Model Development and Quantitative Research Division


The Model Development and Quantitative Research Division's mandate is to provide model?based analytical support to key policies such as carbon pricing and its competitiveness impacts, (e.g., see Economic analysis of the Pan-Canadian Framework - Canada.ca), comparability of greenhouse gas mitigation efforts across countries and long-term technology?based issues such as the implications of 1.5 and 2°C emission pathways and transition to a low carbon economy. The division also develops provincial and territorial macroeconomic projections that support the development of Canada's GHG and air pollutant projections. In undertaking its mandate, the division maintains and uses a suite of Canadian provincial and international Computable General Equilibrium and Integrated Assessment Models for policy design and analysis to support domestic and international policy agenda. The division also maintains a detailed macroeconomic model - The Informetrica Model. With evolving policy priorities and needs, this division's activities provide opportunities for innovation in economic modeling. The division plays an active role in policy development through collaborative research such as Stanford's Energy Modeling Forum, academic engagement and publications in scientific journals such as Energy Economics, Energy Journal, and Climate Change Economics. 


Analysis and Modelling Division


The Analysis and Modeling Division's key mandate is the annual publication of Canada's GHG and air pollutant emissions projections. The division also supports reporting obligations domestically and internationally to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) such as Canada's Seventh National Communication on Climate Change and Fourth Biennial Report, as well as to the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) under the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). In addition, the division supports policy and regulatory development using its Energy, Emissions and Economy Model for Canada (E3MC). 


Regulatory Analysis and Valuation Division


The Regulatory Analysis and Valuation Division conducts economic, cost-benefit, and regulatory analysis for a wide range of regulatory proposals under three Acts; the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, the Species at Risk Act, and the Fisheries Act, covering transportation, fuels, electricity, oil and gas, chemicals, mining, pulp and paper and other industrial sectors summarized and published in the Canada Gazette within the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement. 

  

As well, the division is the department's center of expertise for cost-benefit analysis applied to regulatory proposals, such as for the Regulations Amending the Reduction of Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Coal-fired Generation of Electricity Regulations (http://gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2018/2018-12-12/html/sor-dors263-eng.html). The division responds to increasing expectations for economic analysis in areas such as climate change, air pollution, chemicals management, species at risk, protected areas, environmental impact assessment, and enforcement. Its work informs decisions on stringency and regulatory design for the Government of Canada's environmental regulatory agenda. The division also develops and maintains the capacity for economic valuation of environmental benefits, including air and water quality modelling and the Environmental Valuation Reference Inventory (http://www.evri.ca/).","Key Competencies: 

- You must have studied or are studying at the graduate (Masters) level with a specialization in economics, public administration, international affairs, political science or environmental studies. Focus on environmental economics is an asset.
