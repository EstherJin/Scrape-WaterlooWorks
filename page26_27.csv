							",4 month work term,"Warp: The cloud-backed terminal for individuals and teams

At Warp, we are modernizing the command line experience to make it more intuitive and collaborative for modern developers and teams, turning the terminal into a real platform to enable engineering workflows. Our team is excited to have this opportunity to radically improve a tool that every developer uses and fundamentally change how software development and devops are done.

Our early team is Zach Lloyd (former Google Principal Eng & lead on GDocs), Shikhiu Ing (former UX Lead for GDocs), Nathan Sobo (ex-Github, creator of the Atom editor), Aloke Desai (former Senior Eng on GDocs) and Michelle Lim (Yale, Neo Scholar).
We are looking for engineering interns and co-op students to join us and help bring Warp to the world.

We recently raised a seed round, and are backed by Google Ventures (GV) and other top funds, as well as notable angels like Marc Benioff and the founders of Figma and Coda.

The Product

The CLI is one of the few tools that all developers use every day, and yet it has seen little innovation in the past 40 years.  
We are reinventing this tool to make it more usable and collaborative, turning it from a low-level utility into a modern product.  Because the terminal is so ubiquitous and so antiquated, there is an opportunity to meaningfully elevate developer productivity across the board.

The Role

We are hiring several interns for summer 2021, and are also open to hosting co-op students throughout the year.

Candidates should have completed their first two years of CS education by their start date.

The ideal intern candidate:
* Is passionate about helping developers get more done - would jump at the chance to work on this particular product
* Has amazing engineering chops but also product and user focused
* Great communication and collaboration skills
* Plus: has experience with any of the following:
** building open-source software 
** shell / linux-programming
** openGL/webGL
** building native apps in Rust / WASM
These are just nice-to-haves. We are a community of curious learners, and most of us are learning these for the very first time!

If you join us, you'll have the opportunity to:
* Work on a product that all developers use every day
* Do meaningful engineering work - we are looking for real contributions from our interns
* Learn professional software development from an experienced team
* Be exposed to other aspects of startups, such as product development, project management, customer development.
* Tackle challenging technical problems ? one of the main reasons there has been little innovation in this space is that for historical reasons the terminal / shell division makes it hard to innovate
* Work on a fast moving project right from day one

Our Culture

We are a company run by developers, building a core product for all developers.  

We are committed to understanding our users deeply. We believe we will ultimately build the best product and business if that team includes developers from a wide range of backgrounds.

We value honesty, humility, and pragmatism, and our core product principle is focusing on the user.

To get more of a feel for what our company values on the engineering side, please take a look at our internal How We Work guide and my blog, https://thezbook.com/.

Company Info

We are based in NYC, but we are location agnostic, as we are building a distributed company.

We are currently a team of 5: Zach, Shikhiu, Nathan, Aloke and Michelle. 

The company has around a 2.5-year runway for a team of 10 engineers.

Thank you!

Zach","As an engineering intern
- you will have the opportunity to build end to end features into our Rust and Go codebase
- be mentored by more experienced engineers and learn modern software development best practices

You will essentially funciton as a junior engineer on the team, and, as such, need to be able to write and ship production code.","Ability to produce production quality software.  You should have several other co-ops or internships under your belt and feel comfortable implementing user-facing features.

Specifically
- Strong knowlege of at least one high-level langauge like java, javascript, golang, python, rust, C++, etc
- Strong CS fundamentals: data structures, algortihms, theory, etc
- Good teamwork and communication skills
