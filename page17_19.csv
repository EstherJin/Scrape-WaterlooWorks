A welcoming and tight-knit development team, and technical challenges and high responsibility with job stability and healthy project funding. This is what ODI can offer you.
ODI has been a leader in utilizing modern software development technologies and processes typically found in mature software development firms, with robotics and machine vision approaches you'd expect to see in University labs, and automated metal forming for which we have our own unique IP. We have a history of developing advanced software that utilizes CAD data to achieve manufacturing tasks with robotics that are currently only possible with highly skilled labour, and are now extending this process to the web as a SaaS application. The multidisciplinary team is built up of a combination of experienced engineers and talented career starters in the fields of mechatronics, software, mechanical, and electrical who are in constant collaboration towards a common goal. Coop students have always been a component of this team, and we have been hiring and mentoring students for decades. A factory and machine shop are within the same building in which to develop and test solutions.
The team is currently in need of an individual to work closely with the QA test lead and the software developers to create and conduct automated test plans to ensure the SaaS software meets functional and quality requirements. Being that this is a new project, it is an excellent opportunity to develop an automation framework from scratch. Issues identified are to be documented and reported to the development team. Learning on the job is a must. As a software developer in test, you will liaison between the software development and testing teams, and develop and enhance the technology to the point where it is production ready.

In using network-based approaches for integration of clinical, genetic, genomic, imaging data to find predictive biomarkers? 
Are you interested in a work term at a world-class research institute using basic and translational projects to solve cancer?

Dr. Shraddha Pai works in the field of precision medicine, the goal of which is to match patients to the most effective treatment based on their profile, with minimal side effects. This co-op position will help set up a workflow for predictive modelling for the lab. The result will be a system that can perform on-demand high-throughput prediction of clinical outcomes for datasets profiling several cancer types, such as data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and International Cancer Genome Consortium. This work term will provide an opportunity to implement the pipeline as well as run it on existing datasets to evaluate the predictive power of clinical genomic data. There may be opportunities for other genotype-phenotype analyses, including genome-wide association tests and pathway-based interpretation.
 
About
---------
Dr. Pai's group focuses on computational medicine and in epigenetics of disease, with a passion for translational research. Most recently, Dr. Pai led the development of netDx, a general-purpose patient classifier algorithm that integrates heterogeneous patient data into a single model to predict clinical outcome. It adapts a recommender system model similar to that used by Netflix (""find movies like this one"") to precision medicine (""find patients like non-responders""), and uses prior knowledge of cellular pathways to organize genomic data. Dr. Pai started an independent research group at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research (OICR) in Jan 2021 and is looking to build infrastructure for predictive modeling that will improve cancer outcomes.

This is an opportunity for someone to help design and make an immense impact at a fast-growing company. You should value and practice transparency, have the humility to accept your weaknesses, and continuously strive to improve personally and professionally.

About PerkUp
PerkUp drives employee engagement by allowing companies to issue pre-loaded credit cards to their employees to spend freely on perks they actually want, such as child care, wellness, fitness, home office, and education. These pre-loaded credit cards are marketed as ""perk cards"" and only work with merchants that are supported by PerkUp and approved by the employer. 

In today's work environment, companies must innovate beyond free lunches in order to effectively acquire top talent, improve engagement, and retain high performers. Outside of traditional benefits, it's difficult for HR and finance teams to deploy perk programs that are flexible, inclusive, tax-efficient, and easy to manage. Most companies manage cumbersome and cost-inefficient reimbursement processes or issue a cash stipend which is treated as salary.","Write Typescript/Javascript on the frontend and backend
