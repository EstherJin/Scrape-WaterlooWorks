Founded in 2020, we're building the Shopify for online service businesses. Session was featured (2020) as a finalist in Zoom's App Marketplace Competition, and is the leading business platform for virtual fitness classes.
In the past year, we've helped creators and instructors around the world become entrepreneurs - empowering them to make a living online through teaching virtual classes and offering memberships. Some customers are now making more from Session than their full-time jobs.

Our founding team hails from Y Combinator, Facebook, Reddit, and Samsung. JP (CEO) sold his last startup to Dropbox and led the design of Facebook's Photos and Tagging products. Arjun (CTO) built Reddit's growth engineering team from scratch. Our team members are spread across San Francisco, Pittsburgh, Toronto, and St. Louis.

We are looking for a full-stack software developer to help us accelerate our vision - to empower more people to make a living working for themselves.
You will work closely with the founders and the founding team to build products that delight users. We expect you to apply your technical problem solving skills to help us tackle strategic issues inherent to early stage startups (e.g. growth, engagement, customer success).

Work on projects that empower people to make a living doing what they love. You'll be part of a small and fast-moving engineering team, where you will experience the entire product lifecycle from idea to shipping.

Have real responsibility. As an intern, you will have the responsibilities of full-time engineer. That means you will be working on pressing, high impact issues. You'll have access to push and deploy code to production and you'll immediately ship features that our customers will see.","What you'll do:
- Full-stack web application development using a variety of coding languages and tools (e.g. RoR, React, Postgres, AWS, 3rd party integrations)
- Design, implement, and measure the impact of new products and features for digital service providers and consumers
- Work within the product team to craft compelling user experiences
- Write efficient, scalable and maintainable code that will enable us to move quickly and stably","Qualifications:
- You've built and shipped web applications end-to-end (from DB all the way up to UI), preferably experience with Ruby on Rails
- You're familiar with one or more front-end web frameworks (e.g. React, Vue, Angular)
- Experience in one or more general purpose programming languages (e.g. JavaScript, Python, Java, Go, Scala).

In the era of instant-everything, you shouldn't have to waste an entire afternoon researching, calling and vetting local service professionals whenever you need one. The market for hiring them is huge - $1 trillion in the US alone - but the process is inefficient and largely offline. 

Thumbtack is transforming this experience end-to-end, building a marketplace that matches millions of people with local pros for almost any project. In making these connections, not only do our customers get more done every day, our pros are able to grow their businesses and make a living doing what they're great at.

These customers and pros come from all walks of life and every zip code in the country. We want our team to reflect that. If you come from an underrepresented background in tech, we strongly encourage you to apply. We challenge ourselves every day to make this a place where you can thrive just the way you are, so we can build a product that does the same for our customers and pros.

About the Engineering Team
At Thumbtack, engineers at every level build products and systems that directly impact our customers and professionals.

You'll collaborate with other engineers, designers and product managers to execute on a broad range of projects. This could include building new features to improve the experience of our users, architecting infrastructure to support a fast-­growing user base, or optimizing our marketplace mechanics to make better matches between customers and professionals.

More About Us
Thumbtack is a local services marketplace - one of the largest in the U.S. - that helps millions of people hire local professionals. With hundreds of unique service categories, customers can find a Thumbtack pro for almost anything: landscapers, DJs, personal trainers, even piano teachers. And in making these connections, we empower local pros too. Helping them get new customers and make a living doing what they're great at.

Founded in 2008 and headquartered in San Francisco, Thumbtack is backed by over $400 million in investment from Sequoia Capital, CapitalG, Tiger Global Management, Javelin Investment Partners and Baillie Gifford. 

Thumbtack is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace committed to building a team culture that celebrates diversity, equity and inclusion.","Responsibilities
- Be accountable for the delivery of engineering solutions across all layers of our tech stack - from implementing SQL optimizations one day, to contributing to the UX / UI of our React Native app another day.

Honesty, Integrity and respect aren't a strapline - they're a part of whatever we do. Join us and you'll belong to a world where you can feel pride in your achievements and propel your career with world-class training and development.

Be a part of the Energy Challenge
Our world is exciting, dynamic and fast-moving. Energy plays a critical role in this. It keeps people moving, it takes us places and delivers products around the world. It's a key ingredient in countless things that we rely on every day, from building materials to the clothes on our backs.

As populations grow and thrive, so does the need for more energy.  But, this increasing demand is contributing to rising environmental pressures. We recognize the significance of climate change, along with the role energy plays in helping people achieve and maintain a good quality of life. A key role for society - and for Shell - is to find ways to provide much more energy with less carbon dioxide.

Shell is a willing and able player in this transition. We continue to supply the world with natural gas - the cleanest burning hydrocarbon - to heat and light homes and power industry. We are investing in renewable energy like solar, wind and advanced bio fuels made from waste. We are exploring new ways of storing renewable energy. And we are developing digital products and services that help consumers and businesses use energy more efficiently, day in day out.

Join us to help #MakeTheFuture

An inclusive place to work
To power progress together, we need to attract and develop the brightest minds and make sure every voice is heard. Here are just some of the ways we're nurturing an inclusive environment - one where you can express your ideas, extend your skills and reach your potential.
-We're creating a space where people with disabilities can excel through a transparent recruitment process, workplace adjustments and ongoing support in their roles. Feel free to let us know if you require accommodation when you apply and we'll take it from there. 
-We're closing the gender gap - whether that's through action on equal pay or by enabling more women to reach senior roles in engineering and technology.
-We're committed to building a representative work environment that is reflective of the communities where we live, work and operate. We encourage applications from Indigenous and Visible Minority candidates.
-We're striving to be a pioneer of an inclusive and diverse workplace, promoting equality for employees regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.","What you'll be working on

WHAT WE DO

We are a design strategy firm that is passionate about finding innovative solutions to the most challenging problems.

We're kind of a pain in the ass. We strive to dig deep into any problem we face to find the real opportunity. We work closely with our clients in open and honest dialogue to make sure we deliver what our clients need.

We are always learning and questioning. We believe that true innovation comes from being open to new ideas, constantly learning and challenging assumptions.

We don't take a ""one size fits all"" approach. You won't solve big problems by using standard innovation templates. Because every challenge is unique, we take an equally unique approach to finding the right solution.

We're a little weird. We are made up of inventors, strategist, software and hardware engineers, UI, UX, Visual, ID and Mechanical Designers. We can invent, design, create and build anything.

Ideas over egos. Open project design, everyone has a voice on every project we work on.

Some of these assays are described in publications, others are in databases, but many are still communicated informally. Until this work, there has been no standard format for encoding assay results and no effective, central location for storing them. The aim of this work is to address these long-standing problems by creating a concise and flexible material assay data format and powerful software application to manipulate it. A public installation of this software, available at http://www.radiopurity.org, is the largest database of assay results ever compiled and is intended as a long-term repository for the community's data.","The database above mentioned is currently hosted at SNOLAB and has not been updated since 2017. The project has the goal deliver an improved and updated database of material and assay screening measurements the physics community.
The student will take a leading role in updating a new radiopurity database currently under development using MongoDB along with its web interface via python script. In addition, the student will update the database uploading new available measurements from astroparticle physics experiments.

J.C.Loach, J.Cooley, G.A.Cox, Z.Li, K.D.Nguyen, A.W.P.Poon ""A database for storing the results of material radiopurity measurements"" https://www.sciencedirect.com","A student with strong computer science and database system skills (SQL and MongoDB) would be a good fit for this project. Python and C++ skills are a good asset, as python scripts are used to interface the database.","Targeted Clusters

							",4 month work term,"The SuperCDMS Collaboration has pioneered the use of low temperature phonon-mediated detectors to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and distinguish them from backgrounds. With this powerful technology, operating deep underground in the Soudan mine in Minnesota, CDMS II has provided the most sensitive WIMP search in the world, and this technology has the greatest discovery potential because it has achieved nearly background free performance. The upcoming SuperCDMS SNOLAB project is currently installing a new experimental apparatus in SNOLAB since 2019. The SuperCDMS SNOLAB experiment will improve the present sensitivity for dark matter WIMPs by two orders of magnitude. In the meantime, a cryogenic test facility (CUTE) is currently taking data underground at SNOLAB, in the vicinity of the SuperCDMS allocated space, testing SuperCDMS prototype detectors. The SNOLAB group is/will be supporting both CUTE and SuperCDMS installation, commissioning and science phases.","The student will be actively involved in the data acquisition, simulations and analysis of the CUTE test facility. She/he will play a leading role in understanding and mitigating the environmental backgrounds in CUTE and SuperCDMS. Protection against backgrounds is one of the key issues for the direct dark matter detection experiments. Estimation of the background from radioactive processes becomes a crucial task to inform the final shielding design of the forthcoming test facility and the background budget for the experiment. One of the main tools for background studies is the use of extensive simulation work. This can help with studying background suppression or rejection strategies, and investigation of requirements on the depth, the amount of active/passive shielding, the purity of materials, the veto efficiency, etc. for a given experiment. The SuperCDMS/CUTE group at SNOLAB actively contribute to the efforts to understand and limit the background via MonteCarlo simulations with GEANT4 to estimate radioactive background event rates from the main shielding scheme and via an intensive material and screening assay program. The student will help expanding the ongoing effort in the GEANT4 simulations in terms of neutron and gamma background to any material surrounding the detectors to better understand and estimate the radioactive background budget of the experimental apparatus. Simulation results will be then compared to the first science data.

The student will be joining the activities at the underground laboratory during payload change of the CUTE tower, working in the cleanroom and with SuperCDMS prototype detectors whenever needed and the access to site is granted.","Expertise in data analysis, statistics and modern programming languages is required, ideally in the frame of C++, ROOT and Python. Experience working in a cleanroom laboratory is an advantage.","Targeted Clusters

							",4 month work term,"When the Internet began, people thought connecting everyone together, sharing information freely, and injecting a healthy dose of anarchism would lead to a strong, healthy society. Not really how it turned out, is it?

We started Tailscale because we want to change course and fix what went wrong. Step one is to undo damage from the misguided idea that bigger and more popular means better, and that everything needs to be connected to everything else. Botnets don't need to be connected to your HR database. The private discussion forum with your friends doesn't need to be connected to paid propaganda farms. And teams don't have to be made out of interchangeable lego bricks.

The dream we're building is the Internet, but better. Small, private, secure, distributed networks that you can only join if you're invited. Real communities of real people, unbound from the limits of physical space, but interconnected with the wider world through a lens of mutual obligations, intentionality, and consent.

To make this happen will require a team that's not like your average tech company. We need technical skill, yes, and lots of it, but we also need you to understand beautiful systems, social patterns, and what makes physical and virtual communities feel successful, productive, and secure. We're small - we specialize in small teams - so each of us needs to do a little bit of everything, from design to coding, data analysis, talking to customers, building web sites, writing docs, negotiating contracts, filing patents. Don't worry if you're not good at everything; we're all working together to learn.

Tailscale is currently searching for unique, thoughtful candidates who are technically skilled (especially in areas of networking, security, privacy, or embedded systems) or very community oriented (especially building online communities, helping customers, writing documentation, managing forums). We're looking for the best misfit candidates in the world, who don't accept the way things are going and want to work hard to fix it... together.

This is a full-time, fully-remote position. Our team is spread across Toronto, Montréal, New York City, Seattle, Victoria, San Francisco, and more. We strongly prefer someone based in a North American timezone.","We have a variety of work and projects ranging from backend infrastructure to frontend and mobile development. Some projects from previous terms include: building complex DNS-based support into Tailscale; log management, processing, analytics, and API development; and overhauling Tailscale's admin UI. We attempt to give everyone a term-long project that matches their interests, so please don't hesitate to state a preference.

In general, as a Software Developer you will:
- Build and test sophisticated software spread across our open source (and private) repositories
- Share knowledge and learn from your colleagues' respective areas of expertise
