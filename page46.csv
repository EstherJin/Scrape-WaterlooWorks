We're implementing various details of a centralized knowledge engine for biomedical research (cancer, genetic engineering and more).

Today, science lacks a consistent and standardized format to describe wetlab procedures. This makes it nearly impossible to automatically compare new experimental results with previous results produced globally.

Our software allows cell biology researchers to document details of their wetlab procedure and automatically extract parameters such as culture conditions, incubation times and antibody concentrations so they may be used as columns/features/covariates of their datasets.

The documented details turns into a knowledgebase that automatically uses new results to improve the best predictive model of that experiment, a.k.a the in-silico systems biology models.

Overall, we hope to accelerate disease characterization, accelerate theraputics discovery, accelerate the advent of precision medicine and improve general wellbeing.

							",4 month work term,"Canix (YC S'19) is building the first generation of modern ERP software for the burgeoning cannabis industry. We help our customers overcome daunting compliance regulation, sell more product, cut costs, and optimize their day to day operations from seed to sale. Canix was the winner of TechCrunch Disrupt 2020, check out Stacey's winning pitch to learn more about where we're headed in the next few years.

Why work with us?
- This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Legalization is here, and Canix is not only establishing the technical foundations of the cannabis industry as it grows, but continuously working to improve them with every feature that we ship.
- It's early. It's clear that we're building something people want (and in some cases?need), and our traction shows it. Your work will be pivotal in forming and growing the team, company and the entire industry from the ground up.
- We have a superb founding team, across sales, support, engineering and product. We've built teams, started companies, and developed products and infrastructure used by millions of people around the world before embarking on this journey together.","As an intern, you would take on the responsibilities of a full-time engineer at Canix. After a short ramp-up period, you'll be exposed to a range of projects that we'll prioritize together as a team. Your responsibility will be to scope, prioritize, and execute on the work necessary to get something into the hands of our customers.

Sample Projects:
- Developing (or re-developing) our offline client-side architecture. Canix is the only offline-enabled software in the industry, and we need to continue to push the boundaries with what we can accomplish for our customers with little to no internet connectivity. 
- Hardware integrations with RFID-enabled labels and long-distance readers to power streamlined compliance and sales for some of the biggest players in the cannabis industry. 
- Building the first-ever cannabis CRM. Connecting our customers to buyers & sellers, most of whom have traditionally used ancient email/phone/rolodex type systems to avoid prosecution in the illicit cannabis market.
- Integrating with environmental sensor arrays to power yield forecasting models and proactively prevent crop death.","Tech
Our tech stack is Rails/GraphQL/React/React Native (w/ Typescript). We expect you to come in with a working knowledge of these frameworks and hit the ground running on Day 1. Your code doesn't need to be production-ready right when you start, but expect to get something in the hands of a customer within a week of joining.

You
- Maintain a focus on simplicity over completeness. We pride ourselves on being to-the-point in our product development - if it doesn't solve the problem, it's not worth our time.
- Communicate early and often. We thrive on a culture of open and honest communication, and need someone who can both give and receive feedback on anything ranging from product, to direction, to general culture within the company.
- Take the time to get to know our customers, and step in their shoes when building product (or even infrastructure). In-person meetings and on-sites are encouraged!","Targeted Clusters

We live in a world where some people live on the equity stack and enjoy exponential wealth growth and preferential tax treatment; others live on the debt stack and may work their entire lives for a company and retire only with the cash they've managed to save from their paychecks. By making it as easy to issue equity to employees as it is to put them on payroll, we can create more owners and play a critical role in solving the wealth inequality problem.  

As future founders and start up employees, it's important to understand the value of your equity. To learn more about equity basics, how this impacts you, and why what we're solving is so crucial, check out our blog. 

About the LLC Team: 
We are a diverse team of 10 individuals with big goals. Our goal is to build a $10 million business by the end of 2021. The scope and impact of each individual are immense. We are biased toward action and believe in the mantra of build -> measure -> learn. 

On the team, you'll collaborate closely with our product manager and designer to understand the motivation (why) behind a customer's wants, defining the scope of work (what), and build a solution (how) with your engineering peers to deliver the desired customer value. 

Our team is diverse in multiple axes: gender, nationality, technical specialization, and other quirks ? this our strength. In such an environment, trust and humility are of utmost importance.

Our development philosophy closely mirrors Agile Scrum, but we are not afraid to deviate from it. We care about solving customer problems first and engineering problems second.","Private Equity Firms and LLCs are our customers. You'll help define requirements and build solutions for products that bridge the gap for them. This is a brand new product to address this market.

Here are some problems we need you to help us solve:

LLCs are creatures of contracts, how do we model this variability in Carta? 
LLCs are used to represent many different types of asset classes, how are these nuances represented in the data model and how do they cascade into distinct product experiences? 
Private Equity firms, their investors, the lawyers, and their portfolio companies have many user personas and access controls. How do we offer great experiences to each of these users? 

Job Responsibilities:

Help design and build features that are available, secure, and scalable
Test-driven development (TDD), high levels of code coverage and automation
Peer code review
Logging and monitoring of platforms for proactive assurance of availability and performance
Measuring results of system changes through metrics, both in speed and in business value",We are a React and Java shop.  Prior experience in these technologies is not required.

							",4 month work term,"Quantitative Analyst Co-Op: Natural Gas Trading
Castleton Commodities International is an independent global commodities merchant. As a trader, CCI deploys capital on a proprietary basis in the physical and financial commodity markets, providing the Company with market insights and access. As a strategic investor and developer, CCI leverages its market expertise, operations capabilities, and industry knowledge to invest in, and develop, select commodity infrastructure assets. CCI focuses its activities on the markets it understands best, while constantly striving to expand its knowledge base and network of relationships in order to participate in new markets.
CCI is an active participant in the liquid products markets which consists of trading desks focused on Light Ends, Distillates, Crude, Derivatives, Fuel Oil and Wet Freight. Our global footprint and comprehensive understanding of the fundamentals of the oil market enables us to transact successfully across a wide spectrum of opportunities. We significantly enhanced our capability and presence in these markets with our 2015 acquisition of Morgan Stanley's Global Oil Merchanting business.
CCI's natural gas activities include the ownership of physical reserves, physical and financial trading, leasing of storage and transport capacity, and transacting with producers and consumers. CCI's U.S. Natural Gas business consistently ranks among the top marketers of natural gas in the U.S. transacting on approximately 100 pipelines and over 60 storage facilities to create a geographically diverse portfolio of natural gas assets. CCI's natural gas storage leases comprise one of the largest independent storage portfolios in North America.
CCI's Power business is fully integrated across its research platform, trading activities, and principal investing activities. The Company's trading and investing activities are driven by its proprietary research platform and information flow from its daily activity in the wholesale power markets. CCI participates in the markets for electric energy, capacity, ancillary services, and financial transmission rights across all major power regions in North America. The Company is also active in the European and Australian markets.
CCI's global bulk business deploys capital across a variety of commodity markets which consists of financial derivative trading, physical marketing and asset investing. We participate in markets for coal, iron ore, base metals, agricultural products, and freight across the globe.
Headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, CCI conducts business from offices located around the world including Calgary, Canada; Houston, Texas; New York, New York; Geneva, Switzerland; London, United Kingdom; Montevideo, Uruguay; Singapore, and Shanghai, China. The Company has more than 900 employees across four continents.
 
Co-Op Overview
This is a 4 month co-op working closely with the Calgary based Natural Gas trading team developing quantitative models and creating visualization tools.  The ideal candidate will be a self-starter who has the ability to work under pressure in a fast moving environment. The candidate must have a strong mathematical, statistical and programming background with an interest to learn about a career in the commodity trading industry.  A keen interest in financial markets is required.  This is an ideal opportunity to learn about the commodity markets and more specifically the data impacts that go into the analysis that drives trading decisions.","Examples of Daily/Weekly Responsibilities:

Design and develop quantitative models to analyze fundamental and market data
Develop analytical tools to process large data sets for the purpose of supporting trading strategies
Build visualizations to facilitate efficient viewing of data analytics
Perform research and statistical studies of identified risk factors
Identify market pricing trends and discontinuity
Analyze market pricing data to support portfolio risk management
Help monitor risk exposure for the model inputs and portfolio

Example Projects:
 
The natural gas market has a number of factors which directly affect the supply and demand balance.  These all fluctuate on a daily basis and can result in the price changes across the term structure.  Using our fundamental and price data warehouse, build visualization tools to process data and view relationships in supply and demand data.  Interact with traders to determine which relationships have significant market impacts.
 
Electricity markets are becoming an important driver of demand for natural gas markets. Forecasting electricity demand is becoming increasingly challenging with the proliferation of renewable generation sources in combination with traditional weather volatility. Additionally, fuel substitution potential exists between natural gas and coal at different price levels in various regions. Using proprietary information explore various forecasting techniques to improve electricity demand forecasting.
 
The global gas markets are becoming increasingly interconnected as the North American market increases liquefied natural gas exports.  The pricing relationships between North America, Europe and Asia have become linked as a result.  Using market pricing and fundamental data, build out tools to monitor these pricing relationships and fundamental balances to spot trading opportunities.
 
Financial options are one of the financial instruments that are heavily traded in the natural gas market.  Producers and end-users of natural gas use options to hedge their financial exposure while speculators trade options as one method of volatility exposure.  Using underlying market pricing data, perform statistical analysis on market volatility to identify anomalies in market pricings within the options market.
 
Fundamental data in the natural gas market is spread across a variety of sources and platforms.  The ability to quickly interpret and analyze large datasets containing different types of data is important in identifying asymmetric pricing opportunities.  Using our internal data warehouse, build tools to process and view fundamental data through our online viewing platform.","Qualifications:

Candidates should be in their 4th-6th term.
Prior internship/exposure to the commodities markets, or experience with other financial institutions and consulting is preferred
Excellent analytical and technical skills in one or more of the following: R, Python, Matlab, C++, VBA, Excel - as well as SQL or other database exposure.

The modern world runs on the Internet, and the Internet cannot exist without its underlying infrastructure. Meraki makes setting up, managing, and maintaining that infrastructure easier than it has ever been before. Meraki enables connectivity everywhere from neighborhood cafes to education institutions to global hospitality groups operating thousands of sites.

As a Full Stack Engineer at Meraki, you will help craft and build features for Meraki's Dashboard - the window to the entire Meraki experience. From Dashboard, our customers can control their entire Meraki stack: access points, switches, firewalls, client devices, cameras, and more. You will work across the stack with other developers, UX designers, and product management to build and improve the Dashboard web application. Meraki engineers put the customer experience first, own projects from beginning to end, and are empowered to make impactful decisions.
Meraki believes that the quality of our product is dependent on the quality of our engineers. We place a high value on nurturing the growth and development of everyone on our team. We foster an open and supportive workplace where everybody is given the opportunity to succeed.

Intern Program Overview:
Meraki interns and co-ops join the team for 12 and 16 week programs, respectively, and are placed directly onto subteams. During the program, interns/co-ops have the opportunity to work on a small starter project, such as integration and implementation of new tools, before spending the majority of the program on a larger project, such as building the infrastructure for a new service. Projects are cross functional, which allow insight into new languages and technologies, help encourage professional growth within engineering, and allow a sense of ownership within the team.

Meraki's engineering teams place a high emphasis on mentorship. Each intern and co-op is matched 1:1 with a mentor who provides continual feedback and guidance throughout the duration of the program.  Mentors help with introductions to other team members, overviews of tools and processes, and provide a seamless integration into Meraki life.

Speaking of food, there are dozens of truly excellent restaurants  within walking distance - you will miss this when you go back to school.
